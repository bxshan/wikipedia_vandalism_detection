Associate Creative Consultant Gillian Horvath says about the relationship between Richie and Duncan MacLeod, "Here is this new kid on the block, just learning the ropes and having the best mentor in the world This person who you feel can make anything right, and youre proud to be their sidekick If you look at "Avatar", the inscription on the headstone reads Friend There used to be line in "Archangel", but it was too on the nose, where Richie basically said something along the lines of Im your friend; Im proud to be that But the idea is that there are worse things to be, there are worse things to be remembered as, than Duncan MacLeods best friend Richie was never the hero of his own show, but he was the support of the hero The first season Richie was the same guy for twenty-two weeks And then certain landmarks start defining your characters and start creating arcs Richies going in and out in the second season, think, helped define his character know it was frustrating for Stan he liked being in every show but think it helped define the character because it meant you kept seeing landmark events in his life that kept changing him He becomes Immortal, gets trained, then when he goes away, he comes back in "Prodigal Son" If he had been around every week, he would have just had the Whats up, Mac? scene The fact that hes in fewer episodes means that when he is in an episode, he has something to do In some early versions of "They Also Serve", and in my preferred version of the story, he raced to the rescue of MacLeod at the end Not that he came and took the head of Michael Christian, but Mac was in trouble until Richie got there and threw him his sword And Mac wins because hes got his sword Its moment when, if Richie hadnt been there, Mac could have died They way they filmed it was Mac was already winning when Richie gets there and he doesnt need Richie at all And was little disappointed in that There is an echo of this in "The Messenger", and it was conscious on our parts; when Mac rushes to the rescue and throws Richie his sword, this is an echo of this scene that never happened on-screen, but in my mind it did
