follows: while uncovered element exists, add all at most sets contain this element cover In end we end up with some cover, we output To see that this <math>f</math>-approximation it suffices note that every time we add sets, at least those in optimal cover well For <math>f 2</math>, this normal approximation for vertex cover

The formulates set covering instance relaxed to The resulting linear program can be solved in polynomial time using the and the solutions are rounded to obtain an approximate integral solution
