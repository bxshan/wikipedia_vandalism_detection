In his book <i>Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory Between Past and Future</i>, Nikolas Kompridis describes heterogeneous process that is an important source of ethical, political and cultural change He calls this process "reflective disclosure", after Martin Heideggers insights into the phenomenon of world disclosure, and he argues that social criticism and other practices of critique, especially those that go by the name "critical theory", ought to incorporate Heideggers insights into this phenomenon, and reorient itself around such practices if it is to have, as he puts it, "a future worthy of its past" Kompridis argues that much of what today is called "critical theory" has ignored the utopian concerns which previously animated that tradition, in favour of narrower self-understanding that restricts itself to clarifying the procedures by which we can reach agreement in modern democratic societies Reflective disclosure, on the other hand, describes set of practices through which we can cooperatively imagine and articulate alternatives to present conditions for example, possibilities that were previously untried or suppressed in order to regenerate hope and confidence in the future and offer new ways of "going on" differently These practices constitute part of what Charles Taylor calls "new department" of reason, which is distinct from instrumental reason, or reason understood as the "slave of the passions" Hume and reason as faculty of public justification Rawls In contrast to theories of social change that emphasize socio-historical "contradictions" Marxist and neo-Marxist and to those which explain change through processes that are wholly outside the scope of human agency much of contemporary globalization discourse and in opposition to theories of action that restrict themselves to clarifying procedures for settling moral and political questions Rawls/Habermas Kompridis vision for critical theory calls on its practitioners to reopen the future through practices of reflective disclosure and "intimate critique", by cooperatively expanding the "logical space of possibility or freedom This vision of critical theory is perhaps above all "time-responsive", in part because it recognizes the need for human beings to cooperatively begin anew after breakdowns or crises in our self-understanding that, in Kompridis words, would "preclude going on as before"
