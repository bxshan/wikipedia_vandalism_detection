More advanced systems, called or Directional Infrared Countermeasures, avoid this potential drawback by mounting the energy source on moveable turret much like turret They only operate when cued by missile warning system of missile launch, and use the missile plume to accurately aim at the missile seeker The modulated signal can then be directed at the seeker, and the modulation scheme can be cycled to try to defeat variety of seekers used in military civilian aircraft gain nickname "Live Saver" due history in saving air vehicles during battles several countries but banned several European airports cite news url http://www ynetnews com/articles/0,7340,L-3221013,00 html title Europe objects El Als anti-missile shield publisher
