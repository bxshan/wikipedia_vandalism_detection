portion of the photon weight is absorbed at each interaction site This fraction of the weight is determined as follows: <math>\Delta \frac \mu_a \mu_t W</math> <math>W \leftarrow \Delta \, </math> <math>\cos\theta \end cases </math> And, the azimuthal angle &phi; is generally assumed to be uniformly distributed between and <math> 2\pi </math> Based on this assumption, we can set: <math> </math> \begin align \end align
