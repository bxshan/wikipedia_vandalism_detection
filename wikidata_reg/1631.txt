internallinks date November 2009 The Weather Info for All WIFA Initiative, by the and its partners, is an innovative public-private partnership that strives to reinforce the capacities and the capabilities of national meteorological services with the goal of supporting local communities worst impacted by climate change through the improvement of weather monitoring "By bringing together the expertise and resources of different public and private actors, this project may help to save lives and improve the livelihoods of communities in Africa living on the frontlines of climate change President of the Global Humanitarian Forum The Forum, together with Ericsson, the World Meteorological Organization, National Meteorological Services NMSs the Earth Institute at Columbia University, as well as Zain and other mobile phone operators aim to deploy up to 5,000 automatic weather stations AWSs at wireless network sites across Africa, where less than 300 are reporting today Climate alters patterns causes increased number extreme events, impacting heavily world’s poorest most vulnerable recent Global Humanitarian Forum report estimated responsible some 300,000 deaths each year over 100 billion US dollars worth economic losses, mainly because shocks health agricultural productivity Sub-Saharan Africa accounts close quarter these losses, region most immediate risk droughts floods Agricultural yields some areas expected fall 50% early 2020 Adding to the fact that Africa is the continent worst affected by climate change, it also has the weakest weather monitoring system with only one-eighth of the WMO required weather monitoring density, and less than 300 weather stations that meet WMO observation requirements NMSs across Africa therefore do not have the necessary means to deliver accurate and timely weather forecasts to end-users, when adequate, environmental information and services can play crucial role in improving their lives and livelihoods and can contribute to sustaining economic growth, as well as to mitigating natural disasters As renders traditional knowledge unreliable, lack accurate forecasts prevents farmers from making informed decisions, such when seed harvest their crops Fishermen also with 5’000 people’s lives being claimed Lake Victoria alone due storms accidents Accurate information also crucial understand take action against spread climate-sensitive diseases, well development planning purposes expanding access insurance Through the reinforcement of the capacities of the NMSs, the Initiative is practical solution for adaptation to climate change It aims at enabling them to deliver more accurate weather forecasts and early warnings to communities throughout Africa as well as to develop new services adapted to various user groups such as farmers, health workers, or government agencies Harnessing on the opportunities brought by the development of mobile communication in Africa, partners to the Initiative will install up to 5,000 AWSs at new and existing wireless network sites throughout Africa and reinforce the capacities of the NMSs to generate accurate weather forecasts and early warnings The data collected these stations will be analyzed transformed into sector-specific forecasts early warnings distributed end-users who need most farmers, fishermen, rural, urban communities via suitable telecoms bearer, for example, SMS “This initiative may prove to be one of the most important for African meteorology in decades Reinforcement NMSs capacities capabilities: Installation AWSs will reinforce existing observation network NMSs capacities allow development improved services delivery adequate end-users Health: Weather forecasts allow for the implementation of preventive measures against climate-sensitive diseases and epidemics, such as malaria, cholera, and dengue fever Finance: Farmers whose crops are insured through index policies have greater possibilities accessing finance, which can help farmers increase crop yields incomes AWSs use sensors to take measurements of variety of meteorological parameters Those deployed for the Initiative conform to WMO specifications These units are robust and able to withstand various environmental conditions, yet are economical to operate, calibrate and maintain They are run on state of the art proprietary software able to handle the reporting of large network of weather stations and able to detect faulty sensors remotely in real time Atmospheric pressure Temperature Humidity Wind Speed and direction Precipitation Sunshine and radiation As end June 2009, Global Humanitarian Forum its partners have completed Phase Initiative installed 19 AWSs in three East African countries: in Kenya, in Tanzania in Uganda All 19 AWSs are fully operational successfully transferring raw weather data to NMSs Phase II of the Initiative is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2010 About 500 AWSs will progressively be installed throughout Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, with the later addition of Burundi and Rwanda The event was held at the Global Platform Disaster Risk Reduction, in Geneva, Switzerland was attended by number of personalities who presented the rationale this Initiative its benefits the world’s poorest most vulnerable to climate change Also present at the launch were: Michel Jarraud, Secretary General of the WMO, Carl-Henric Svanberg, CEO of Ericsson, Lord Simon Cairns, Chairman of Zain Africa, as well as Margareta Wahlström, UN Assistant Secretary General for
