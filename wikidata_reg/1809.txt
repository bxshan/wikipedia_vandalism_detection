Some time later the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall were magically transported to Themyscira by the witch Circe Once there the Egyptian Amazons attacked the Themyscirian Amazons in order to claim the island as their own During the battle Circe double-crossed the Banas and sent the entire island of Themyscira into demon dimension along with both tribes of Amazons The two tribes put aside their rivalry in order to defend themselves against the demons Once the island was returned to its original setting the Bana Amazons were giving small portion of the island to dwell while the remaining Themyscirian Amazons lived in the city walls Hippolyta received visions during this period that Wonder Woman would die Because of this she had Philippus arrange for new Contest for the title of Wonder Woman

the point where she felt she couldnt lead her people anymore Hippolyta officially gave rule of Themyscira over to Philippus and banished herself in small one-person sized boat Philippus took her rule seriously but later admitted to Diana that she was more comfortable guiding the Amazon armies at war time than she did the day-to-day rule of an entire nation When Diana refused to take over rule of the island Philippus reluctantly continued to serve as Queen Hippolyta eventually returned to Themyscira and took back her crown Civil war then broke out between both island tribes due to the fluctuating rule and growing tensions In order to end the war Diana and Hippolyta denounced their crowns and gave over the island to Philippus and resurrected Artemis to act as co-rulers During their official rule they opened the island to outworlders, both on Earth and alien worlds When the alien being invaded Earth the Amazons joined in the battle which lead to Hippolytas death This devistated
