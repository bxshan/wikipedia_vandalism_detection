Surveys show particularly dreams, considered real one third general population One survey sought validate Australian Sheep-Goat Scale paranormal Three items on 18-item scale specifically refer validation study involving 234 Australian psychology students, experience reported 35% participants, occurring dreams, 38%, occurring wakeful premonition Additionally, 27% participants affirmed possibility <ref>Thalbourne, Delin, 1993 new instrument measuring sheep-goat variable: Its psychometric properties factor structure 59, 172-186 History records many instances of apparent precognition, and belief in its occurrence as form of seeing into the future this can be through visions, or through dreams which is usually the cause of recognition <ref>Dodds, 1971 Supernormal phenomena in classical antiquity Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, 55, 189-237 </ref> The first thorough collection and critical review of such spontaneous cases was created by the British SPR This involved checking the veracity of peoples reports by interviewing witnesses, and obtaining objective evidence of the occurrence of the precognition prior to the events occurrence Substantial reports of these cases were authored by in 1888<ref>Sidgwick, 1888 On the evidence for premonitions Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, 5, 288-354 </ref>, and Saltmarsh in 1938 Sidgwick believed the evidence warranted further investigation as to the validity of the concept of precognition, and Saltmarsh offered that the evidence, if it did not scientifically establish the phenomenon, at least excluded alternative hypotheses Nicol, however, in later review, came to the conclusion that their evidence was not so suggestive, given, in particular, the long length of time between the occurrence of some of the most suggestive cases, and their first report to the SPR <ref>Nicol, 1961 Apparent spontaneous precognition: historical review International Journal of Parapsychology, 26-39 </ref> Robert Van de Castle summarizes some of the key progress points in the area of dream research in his book Our Dreaming Mind In 1819, Wesserman successfully projected messages to experimental subjects while they slept and dreamed While the general content of the dream was successfully received, some of the characters in the dreams were changed <ref>Van de Castle, Robert, PhD “Our Dreaming

young girl Perhaps the best-known research in this field was conducted at in Brooklyn, New York by and Montigue Ullman in 1964 These trials clearly showed positive correlations for transmitting information to dreamers who had no prior knowledge of the subject material Dr Van de Castle himself was subject during these sessions and achieved considerable success in having dreams that were closely correlated to the target pictures Citation needed date October 2009 Van de Castle further documents the evidence for dreaming based on questionnaire approach Survey questions sent to several thousand individuals listed in Who’s Who In America resulted in 430 replies claiming some kind of experience and dreams were involved in 25 percent of these cases Citation needed date May 2008 Louisa Rhine at the Parapsychology Laboratory at compiled by far the best-known and largest body of such dream evidence fact Dr Rhine collected over 7000 accounts of ESP experiences The majority of these accounts were dream related and were seemingly precognitive in nature The material for this work was collected by advertisements in various well-known popular media Citation needed date May 2008 David Ryback, psychologist in used questionnaire survey approach to investigate precognitive dreaming in college students His survey of over 433 participants showed that 290 or 66 percent reported some form of paranormal dream He rejected many of these claims and reached conclusion that percent of the population was having actual precognitive dreams <ref>Ryback, David, PhD “Dreams That Came True” New York: Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, 1988 </ref> An early inquiry into this phenomenon was done by Aristotle in his His criticism of these claims appeals to the fact that "the sender of such dreams should be God", and "the fact that those to whom he sends them are not the best and wisest, but merely commonplace persons Thus: "Most so-called prophetic dreams are, however, to be classed as mere coincidences ", here "coincidence" being defined by Aristotle as that which does not take "place according to universal or general rule" and referring to things which are not of themselves by necessity causally connected, his example being taking walk during an eclipse, neither the walk nor the eclipse being apparently causally connected and so only by "coincidence" do they occur simultaneously <ref>Aristotle, http://classics mit edu/Aristotle/prophesying html On Divination in Sleep </ref> Other researchers in this area are more guarded in their reports on the value or use of dreams In his book first published at the end of the 19th century, argued that the foundation of all dream content is the fulfillment of wishes, conscious or not and devoid of content fact In his discussions with he referred to and as “nonsensical fact Dreams which appear to be precognitive may in fact be the result of the "Law of Large Numbers" author of "The Skeptics Dictionary" put it this way: :"Say the odds are million to one that when person has dream of an airplane crash, there is an airplane crash the next day With billion people having an average of 250 dream themes each per night, there should be about million people day who have dreams that seem clairvoyant "<ref> http://skepdic com/lawofnumbers html Law of Truly Large Numbers<!-- Bot generated title --> </ref> Barrett,
