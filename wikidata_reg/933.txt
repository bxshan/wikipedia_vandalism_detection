Briefly, finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebra are so it suffices to classify irreducible simple representations Semisimple Lie algebras are classified in terms of the of the adjoint representation, the so-called in similar manner all finite-dimensional irreducible representations can be understood in terms of weights; see for details
