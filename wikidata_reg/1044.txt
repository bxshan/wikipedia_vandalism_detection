Cage was born in His father John Milton Cage Sr 1886&ndash;1964 was an inventor, and his mother Lucretia "Crete" Harvey 1885&ndash;1969 worked intermittently as journalist for the The familys roots were completely American: in 1976 interview Cage mentioned "a John Cage who helped George Washington in the surveying of Virginia" <ref>Cage quoted in Kostelanetz 2003, For details on Cages ancestry, see, for example, Nicholls 2002, 4&ndash;6 </ref> Cage described his mother as woman with "a sense of society" who was "never happy", while his father is perhaps best characterized by his inventions: sometimes idealistic, such as diesel-fueled that gave off exhaust bubbles, the senior Cage being uninterested in an undetectable submarine John Milton Sr taught his son that "if someone says cant that shows you what to do In 1944&ndash;45 Cage wrote two small dedicated to his parents: Crete and Dad The latter is short lively piece that ends abruptly, while "Crete" is slightly longer, mostly melodic

private piano teachers in the area and several relatives, particularly his aunt Phoebe Harvey who introduced him to the piano music of 19th century He received first piano lessons when he was in the fourth grade at school, but although he liked music, he expressed more interest in than in developing virtuoso piano technique, and apparently was not thinking of composition <ref>Kostelanetz 2003,

forms of art First he studied and but decided he was not interested enough in architecture to dedicate his life to it <ref name "Kostelanetz, 4"/> He then took up painting, poetry and music It was in Europe that he first heard the music of contemporary composers such as and and finally got to know the music of which he had not experienced before After several months in Paris Cages enthusiasm for America was revived after he read &ndash; he wanted to return immediately, but his parents, with whom he regularly exchanged letters during the entire trip, persuaded him to stay in Europe for little longer and explore the continent <ref>Perloff, Junkerman 1994, 80 </ref> Cage started travelling, visited various places in France, Germany and Spain, as well as and, most importantly, where he started composing <ref>Nicholls 2002, 22 </ref> His first compositions were created using dense mathematical formulae, but Cage was displeased with the results and left the finished pieces behind when

and producing enjoyment "<ref>Cage quoted in Perloff, Junkerman, 1994, 81 </ref> Cage returned to the United States in 1931 and arts patron Galka Scheyer <ref name "Kostelanetz, 4"/> By 1933 Cage decided to concentrate on music rather than painting "The people who heard my music had better things to say about it than the people who looked at my paintings had to say about my paintings", Cage later explained <ref name "Kostelanetz, 4"/> In 1933 he sent some of his compositions to the reply was "rather vague letter",<ref>Cage quoted in Nicholls 2002, 24 </ref> in which Cowell suggested that Cage study with &mdash;Cages musical ideas at the time included composition based on 25-, somewhat similar to Schoenbergs <ref>Kostelanetz 2003, 61 </ref> Cowell mentioned, however, that before approaching Schoenberg, Cage should take some preliminary lessons, and recommended Adolph Weiss, former Schoenberg pupil <ref>Nicholls 2002, 24 </ref> Following Cowells advice, Cage travelled to New York City in 1933 and started studying with Weiss as well as taking lessons from Cowell himself at Cages routine during that period was apparently very tiring, with just four hours of sleep on most nights, and four hours of composition every morning starting at AM Several months later, still in 1933, Cage became sufficiently good at composition to approach Schoenberg <ref group "n">Different sources give different details of their first meeting Pritchett, in Grove, implies that Cage met Schoenberg in New York City: "Cage followed Schoenberg to Los Angeles in 1934", however, in 1976 interview quoted in Kostelanetz 2003, 5, Cage mentions that he "went to see him Schoenberg in Los Angeles "</ref> He could not afford Schoenbergs price, however, and when he mentioned it, the older composer asked whether Cage would devote his life to music After Cage replied that he would, Schoenberg offered to tutor him for free <ref>This conversation was recounted many times by Cage himself: see ;261; ;44; interviews quoted in Kostelanetz 2003, pp ;5, 105; etc </ref> Cage studied with Schoenberg in California: first at and then at as well as privately particularly as an example of how to live ones life being composer <ref name "Pritchett, 9"/> The vow Cage gave, to dedicate his life to music, was apparently still important some 40 years later, when Cage "had no need for it writing music ", he continued composing partly because of the promise he gave <ref>Cage interview quoted in Kostelanetz 2003, 105 </ref> Schoenbergs methods and their influence on Cage are well documented by Cage himself in various lectures and writings Particularly well-known is the conversation mentioned in the 1958 lecture Indeterminacy: <blockquote>After had been studying with him for two years, Schoenberg said, "In order to write music, you must have feeling for harmony explained to him that had no feeling for harmony He then said that would always encounter an obstacle, that it would be as though came to wall through which could not pass said, "In that case will devote my life to beating my head against that wall "<ref>Cage 1973, 260 </ref></blockquote> Cage studied with Schoenberg for two years, but although he admired his teacher, he decided to leave after Schoenberg told the assembled students that he was trying to make it impossible for them to write music Much later, Cage recounted the incident: When he said that, revolted, not against him, but against what he had said determined then and there, more than ever before, to write music "<ref name "Kostelanetz, 6"/> Although Schoenberg never complimented Cage on his compositions during these two years, in later interview he said that none of his American pupils were interesting, except Cage: "Of course hes not composer, but hes an inventor&mdash;of genius "<ref name "Kostelanetz, 6"/> At some point in 1934&ndash;5, during his studies with Schoenberg, Cage was working at his mothers arts and crafts shop, where he met artist Xenia Andreyevna Kashevaroff She was an n-born daughter of Russian priest; her work encompassed fine and Although Cage was involved in relationship with Don Sample when he met Xenia, he fell in love immediately Cage and Kashevaroff were married in the desert at on June 7, 1935 <ref>For details on Cages first meeting with Xenia, see Kostelanetz 2003, 7&ndash;8; for details

married couple first lived with Cages parents in then moved to <ref>Perloff, Junkerman, 86</ref> During 1936&ndash;8 Cage changed numerous jobs, including one that started his lifelong association with modern dance: dance accompanist at the He produced music for choreographies and at one point taught course on "Musical Accompaniments for Rhythmic Expression" at the UCLA, with his aunt Phoebe It was during that time that Cage first started experimenting with unorthodox instruments, such as household items, metal sheets, and so on This was inspired by who told Cage that "everything in the world has spirit that can be released through its sound Although Cage did not share the idea of spirits, these words inspired him to begin exploring the sounds produced by hitting various non-musical objects <ref name "Revill 1993, 55"/><ref>Kostelanetz 2003, 43 </ref> In 1938, with help from fellow Cowell student Cage became faculty member at teaching the same program as at the UCLA, and collaborating with choreographer Marian van Tuyl Several famous dance groups were present, and Cages interest in modern dance grew further <ref name "Revill 1993, 55"/> After several months he left and moved to where he found work as composer and accompanist for choreographer Bonnie Bird at the The Cornish School years proved to be particularly important period in Cages life Aside from teaching and working as accompanist, Cage organized percussion ensemble that toured the West Coast and brought the composer his first fame His reputation was enhanced further with the invention of the &mdash;a piano which has had its sound altered by objects placed on the strings&mdash;in 1940 This concept was originally intended for performance staged in room too small to include full percussion ensemble It was also at the Cornish School that Cage met number of people who became lifelong friends, such as painter and dancer The latter was to become Cages lifelong partner and collaborator Cage left Seattle in Summer 1941, after painter invited him to teach at the The composer accepted partly because he hoped to find opportunities in Chicago, that were not available in Seattle, to organize center for experimental music These opportunities, however, did not materialize Cage taught at the Chicago School of Design and worked as accompanist and composer at the University of Chicago At one point, his reputation as percussion composer landed him commission from the to compose soundtrack for radio play by The result, The City Wears Slouch Hat, was received well, and Cage deduced that more important commissions would follow Hoping to find these, he left Chicago for in the spring of 1942 listen filename Cage-widow-excerpt ogg title Excerpt from The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs

and she offered to organize concert of Cages music at the opening of her gallery, which included paying for transportation of Cages percussion instruments from Chicago However, after she learned that Cage secured another concert, at the Guggenheim withdrew all support, and, even after the ultimately successful MoMA concert, Cage was left homeless, unemployed and penniless The commissions he hoped for did not happen He and Xenia spent the summer of 1942 with dancer and her husband Without the percussion instruments, Cage again turned to prepared piano, producing substantial body of works for performances by various choreographers, including Merce Cunningham, who moved to New York City several years earlier Cage and Cunningham eventually became romantically involved, and Cages marriage, already breaking up during the early 1940s, ended in divorce in 1945 Cunningham remained Cages partner for the rest of his life Cage also countered the lack of percussion instruments by writing, on one occasion, for voice and closed piano: the resulting piece, 1942 quickly became popular and was performed by the celebrated duo of and <ref>Reinhardt, Lauriejean John Cages "The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs", http://memory loc gov/ammem/collections/moldenhauer/moldtoc html Available online </ref> Like his personal life, Cages artistic life went through crisis in mid-1940s The composer was experiencing growing disillusionment with the idea of music as means of communication: the public rarely accepted his work, and Cage himself, too, had trouble understanding the music of his colleagues In early 1946 Cage agreed to tutor Gita Sarabhai, an Indian musician who came to the US to study Western music In return, he asked her to teach him about Indian music and philosophy <ref>Cage 1973, 127 </ref> Cage also attended, in late 1940s and early 1950s, lectures on<ref>Revill 1993, 108 </ref> and read the works of <ref name "Pritchett, Grove" /> The first fruits of these studies were works inspired by Indian concepts: for prepared piano, and others Cage accepted the goal of music as explained to him by Sarabhai: "to sober and quiet the mind, thus rendering it susceptible to divine influences" <ref>Cage 1973, 158 </ref> Sonatas and Interludes were received well by the public After 1949 performance at Cage received grant from the which enabled him to make trip to Europe, where he met composers such as and More important, however, was Cages chance encounter with in New York City in early 1950 Both composers attended New York Philharmonic Orchestra, where the orchestra performed Weberns Symphony, op 21, followed by piece by Cage felt so overwhelmed by Weberns piece that he left before the Rachmaninoff; and in the lobby, he met Feldman, who was leaving for the same reason <ref>Revill 1993, 101 </ref> The two composers quickly became friends; some time later Cage, Feldman, and Cages pupil came to be referred to as "the New York school

book would then be used in much the same way as it is used for divination For Cage, this meant "imitating nature in its manner of operation":<ref>Pritchett 1993, 97 </ref><ref>Revill 1993, 91 </ref> his lifelong interest in sound itself culminated in an approach that yielded works in which sounds were free from the composers will: <blockquote>When hear what we call music, it seems to me that someone is talking And talking about his feelings, or about his ideas of relationships But when hear traffic, the sound of traffic&mdash;here on Sixth Avenue, for instance&mdash;I dont have the feeling that anyone is talking have the feeling that sound is acting And love the activity of sound dont need sound to talk to me <ref>John Cage, in an interview with Miroslav Sebestik, 1991 From:

standard tool for composition: he used it in practically every work composed after 1951 Despite the fame Sonatas and Interludes earned him, and the connections he cultivated with American and European composers and musicians, Cage was quite poor Although he still had an apartment, at 326 Monroe Street which he occupied since around 1946 his financial situation in 1951 worsened so much that, while working on Music of Changes, he prepared set of instructions for Tudor as to how to complete the piece in the event of his death <ref>Revill 1993, 142 </ref> Nevertheless, Cage managed to survive and maintained an active artistic life, giving lectures, performances, etc In 1952&ndash;53 he completed another mammoth project&mdash;the Williams Mix, piece of which helped to put together <ref>Revill

the entire duration of the piece&mdash;four minutes, thirty-three seconds&mdash;and is meant to be perceived as consisting of the sounds of the environment that the listeners hear while it is performed Cage conceived "a silent piece" years earlier, but was reluctant to write it down; and indeed, the premiere given by Tudor on 29 August 1952 at caused an uproar in the audience <ref>Revill 1993, 166 </ref> The reaction to 4â€²33 was just part of the larger picture, however: on the whole, it was the adoption of chance procedures that had disastrous consequences for Cages reputation The press, which used to react favorably to earlier percussion and prepared piano music, ignored his new works, and many valuable friendships and connections were lost who used to promote Cages work in Europe, was opposed to Cages use of chance, and so were other composers who came to prominence during the 1950s, and <ref>Revill 1993, 174</ref> From 1953 onwards, Cage was busy composing music for modern dance, particularly Cunninghams dances Cages partner adopted chance too, out of fascination for the movement of the human body as well as developing new methods of using chance, in series of

minimal script, with no plot In fact, "happening" is so-named because it occurs in the present, attempting to arrest the concept of passing time Cage believed that theater was the closest route to integrating art and real life The term "Happenings" was coined by one of his students, who was to define it as genre in the late fifties Cage met Kaprow while on mushroom hunt with and invited him to join his class In following these developments Cage was strongly influenced by â€™s seminal treatise The Theatre and Its Double, and the happenings of this period can be viewed as forerunner to the
