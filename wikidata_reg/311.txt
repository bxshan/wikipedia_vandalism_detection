StructureYep, Im working on "loaner appreciate the fix it shop letting me use an old iMac until mine is fixed, but gosh do miss my machine! This ones got quarter the RAM and, well, its slow lot of my software wont work because this is PowerPC iMac and my software needs the newer Pentium models But at least Im working! Now if just had little more to work on Goofiness saw on TV that lot of Republicans are up in arms over the budget, claiming there are too many earmarks and "pork" projects Turns out this portion of the budget is less than 2% of the total Theyre rejecting 98% good to kill 2% that they perceive as bad Well, can still understand that -- mean, who wants wasteful spending? Then saw Lindsey Graham R-SC on TV bashing the budget, saying that President Obama should cut all earmarks from the bill The TV host pointed out that Graham himself had inserted measure in the budget that would send over $900,000 to South Carolina "Yes," said Graham "And if the President cuts that Ill put it into another bill In other words, he wants everyone elses pet projects cut, just not HIS little more research shows that Grahams state would receive over $75 million in earmarks Thankfully during this housing crisis $285,000 of it, or 0038%, will go towards improving low-income housing in the state Then read that in spite of all their complaints, Republicans themselves are responsible for nearly half the earmarks in the bill hope President Obama does take measures to limit pork spending and earmarks realize it was too late for him to do so on this years budget as the budget is already six months behind which means it should have passed under the Bush administration, who was strong proponent of earmark spending but hope the Obama administration takes this issue to heart next year But it just doesnt make sense to me that the Republicans are all hollering at President Obama for budget THEY put together with THEIR earmarks Oh well Incidentally, one of the earmarks comes from my own Senator -- Tom Harkin D-IA It would give several million dollars to find way to make hog production less odoriferous This sounds funny -- spending money to make pigs stink less -- but if youve ever been within five miles of hog confinement, you KNOW something needs to be done about this! If someone can come up with bacteria or something that can help reduce the odor from the waste lagoons, that would make rural areas much happier place! mean, if you have 5,000 hogs living in confined area, youre gonna have waste management issues Its real concern Same goes to having 435 United States Representatives in confined area, actually The whole thing is ridiculous Lets just make it illegal to put this kind of stuff in bill If you want money to de-stinkify pigs or build bridge or whatever, make it stand-alone piece of legislation These projects are actually all pretty important to the people living in those areas They shouldnt be dealt with in such sneaky manner Gettin Itchy Its been long, cold winter Weve had few days of warmth and sunshine, but overall its been nasty season The past few days weve had highs in the teens and 20s and lows below zero Its not supposed to be like that in mid-March! But thankfully the weather broke yesterday and we got up to about 28 degrees Today its supposed to be in the 40s, which is about normal for this time of year WILL be getting the bike out of storage Sunday! Its gotta happen -- Im getting just wee bit stir-crazy Posted by Chris at 8:25 AM comments: Dale said Hahaha, loved your comparison of confined hog and representatives! 9:32 AM SkylersDad said Hope you get your computer back soon, and agree with Dale great comparison! 10:24 AM said grew up in painfully small town in Nebraska So small, in fact, that the Webers hog farm out by the football field was actually larger, geographically, than the town itself There were Friday nights that they actually had to cancel the football game because the wind was blowing the wrong way De-stinkifying pigs should be the nations highest priority!! But de-stinkifying congress has to come first 11:09 AM The Vegetable Assassin said Hell yes, stir crazy, know all about that!!! Glad your loaner is at least better than nothing 1:06 PM soul pumpkin said as the grandson of hog farmer, know well the ferocious stink that can arise from collection of our porcine pals if ever there should be some stand alone legislation, there it is actually, all legislation should be done in that manner none of this, "Look at the pretty bauble in this hand while shit is being shoveled with other and it truly amazes me that the Republicans drive the economy into the ditch and then bitch about the size of the tow truck we need to pull it out typical 1:08 PM Post Comment Links to this post Create Link Newer Post Older Post Home Subscribe to: Post Comments Atom Quick Links Radloff Family Website Chris Band Blog Archive 2009 67 November Veterans Day Pic the Day, Day 12-13 Pic the Day, Day 11 Pic the Day, Day 10 Pic the Day, Day 7-9 October Pic the Day, Day Photo the Day, Day Photo, Day Obligatory Political Rant Photo, Day Photo of the Day Yeah, okay September Aw, shoot Do Tax Cuts Really Work?
