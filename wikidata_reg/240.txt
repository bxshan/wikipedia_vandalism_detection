In the earliest scripts of Highlander Endgame, the main antagonist was first introduced as an unnamed, powerful Immortal stalking Connor and killing his close friends to fulfill an unknown agenda Later, the characters name was revealed to be Jacob Kase This was the name used throughout the original script However, this was modified from Kase to Kell after comments that it sounded too phonetically similar to the previous Highlander III villain Kane The resulting name although not Scottish in origin was used in the filming of the movie Kell is portrayed initially as crusader out to avenge the death of his mentor at Connors hands The struggle between Kell and Connor was to mirror to certain extent the relationship between Kate and Duncan, respectively as well as explore the possibility of an evil antagonist with close ties to the clan MacLeod Despite the changes between the script and movie, the actual Jacob Kell retained much of his personality---his metamorphosis from reluctant enforcer of justice to sadistic mad-dog killer played an important part in the film
