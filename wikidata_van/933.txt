The s, which include s, and es, reproduce both sexually and They are small plants found growing in moist locations and like ferns, have motile sperm with and need water to facilitate sexual reproduction These plants start as haploid spore that grows into the dominate form, which is multicellular haploid body with leaf-like structures that Haploid gametes are produced in antherida and archegonia by mitosis The sperm released from the antherida respond to chemicals released by ripe archegonia and swim to them in film of water and fertilize the egg cells thus producing zygote The zygote divides by mitotic division and grows into sporophyte that is diploid The multicellular diploid sporophyte produces structures called s, which are connected by to the archegonia The spore capsules produce spores by meiosis, when ripe the capsules burst open and the spores are released Bryophytes show considerable variation in their breeding structures and the above is basic outline Also in some species each plant is one sex while other species produce both sexes on the same plant <ref>Lovett Doust, Jon, and Lesley Lovett Doust 1988 Plant reproductive ecology: patterns and strategies New York: Oxford University Press 290 </ref>
