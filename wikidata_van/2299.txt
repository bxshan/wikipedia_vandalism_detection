Ish spends most of his elderly life in fog, unaware of the world Superstition has set in; the tribe has reverted to primitive lifestyle, hunting with dogs the descendants of Ishs first dog and bow and arrow Occasionally the fog in his mind lifts During one such time, he finds himself aware of his great-grandson Jack, who stands before him Jack shows him that the bow and arrow have become more reliable than the whose dont always work The children of the world are taking the toys of their youth and improving them on their own During his last lucid moments, Ish realizes that the former civilization is now totally gone But he also wonders if the new world is that much worse off than the old world, and finds himself hoping that the new world will not rebuild civilization and its mistakes Then he runs into wall, breaking his head and laying on the ground dying until he starts to lift up to heaven but was hit in the head with his God damn hammer
