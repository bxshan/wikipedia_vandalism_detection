Molecular cloning refers to the process of making multiple copies of defined sequence Cloning is frequently used to amplify DNA fragments containing whole but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA It is used in wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from to large scale protein production Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the location of gene associated with particular phenotype of interest, such as in In practice, localization of the gene to chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence In order to amplify any DNA sequence in living organism, that sequence must be linked to an which is sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence However, number of other features are needed and variety of specialised small piece of DNA into which foreign DNA fragment can be inserted exist that allow tagging, single stranded and DNA production and host of other manipulations useful tissue culture technique clone distinct lineages cell lines involves use cylinders According this technique, single-cell suspension cells have been exposed drug drive plated at high dilution create isolated colonies; each arising potentially clonally distinct cell At early growth stage when colonies consist only few cells, sterile rings rings have been dipped grease placed over individual colony amount added Cloned cells collected inside ring transferred new vessel for further growth Organism cloning also called reproductive cloning refers to the procedure of creating new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place Asexual reproduction is naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants see and some insects Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows There is lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used However cloning, or asexual propagation, http://aggie-horticulture tamu edu/plantanswers/misc/asexualpropagation html has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years
