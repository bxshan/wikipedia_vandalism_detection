One of Oppenheimers first acts was to host summer school for bomb theory at his building in Berkeley The mix of European physicists and his own students—a group including and —busied themselves calculating what needed to be done, and in what order, to make the bomb Teller put forward the remote possibility that the bomb would generate enough heat to ignite the atmosphere While such an event was soon shown to be impossible by Bethe, Oppenheimer nevertheless was concerned enough to meet with in to discuss the situation At the time, research for the project was going on at many different universities and laboratories across the country, presenting problem for both security and cohesion Oppenheimer and Groves decided that they needed centralized, secret research laboratory Scouting for site in late 1942, Oppenheimer was drawn to New Mexico, not far from his ranch the final site picked would be 40 miles from Perro Caliente After Groves turned down proposed site in walled canyon, Oppenheimer suggested site which he knew well: flat near which was the site of private boys school called Sp Los Alamos means "The Cottonwoods" Minutes after seeing the mesa site, Groves was convinced, and approached the owners to sell it The laboratory was thus hastily built on the site of the school, taking over some of its buildings, but building many others in great haste There Oppenheimer assembled group of the top physicists of the time, which he referred to as the "luminaries "<ref> harvnb Smith 1980 227 </ref> then an unknown post-doctoral student and as well as Bethe and Teller, were already famous or would soon become famous
