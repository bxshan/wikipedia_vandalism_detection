The modern numerical digit is usually written as circle, an ellipse, or rounded rectangle In most modern s, the height of the character is the same as the other digits However, in typefaces with the character is often shorter align "right" On the of calculators, watches, and household appliances, is usually written with six line segments, though on some historical calculator models it was written with four line segments The value, or number, zero is not the same as the digit zero, used in using Successive positions of digits have higher weights, so inside numeral the digit zero is used to skip position and give appropriate weights to the preceding and following digits zero digit is not always necessary in positional number system, for example, in the number 02 In rare instances, leading may distinguish number This appears in in the United States, where 00 is distinct from wager on will not win if the ball lands in 00, and vice versa Sports where competitors are numbered follow this as well; numbered 07 would be considered distinct from one numbered This is most common with single-digit numbers Traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter more rounded than narrower, elliptical digit The digit with dot in the centre seems to have originated as an option on displays Its appearance has continued with the typeface One variation used short vertical bar instead of the dot This could be confused with the on badly focused display, but in practice there was no confusion because theta was not then displayable character and very little used anyway An alternative, the looking similar to the letter except for the slash was primarily used in hand-written coding sheets before transcription to punched cards or tape, and is also used in old-style graphic sets descended from the default typewheel on the This form is similar to the symbol <math>\emptyset</math>, or "∅" character U+2205 representing the as well as to the letter used in several Some equipment displays digit with reversed slash The opposing convention that has the letter with slash and the digit without was advocated by SHARE, prominent user group, and by few other early mainframe makers; this is even more problematic for ns because it means two of their letters collide Others advocated the opposite convention,<ref name "bemer" /> including IBM for writing programs <ref name "einarsson" /> Another convention used on some early left digit unornamented but added tail or hook to the capital so that it resembled an inverted or cursive capital letter-O <math>\mathcal O</math> <ref name "bemer" /> Some fonts designed for use with computers made one of the capital-O–digit-0 pair more rounded and the other more angular closer to rectangle The computer featured more angular capital and more rounded digit 0, whereas others made the choice the other way around The typeface used on most an distinguishes the two symbols partially in this manner having more rectangular or wider shape for the capital than the digit but in several countries further distinction is made by slitting open the digit on the upper right side as in using the "harder-to-falsify script" Sometimes the digit is used either exclusively, or not at all, to avoid confusion altogether For example, http://southwest com/content/travel_center/retrieveCheckinDoc html confirmation numbers used by use only the capital letters and instead of the digits and 1, while use only the digits and and never the capital letters and I, although letters and numbers always alternate
