Cowbridge lang-cy Bont-faen is one of those tiny little boring Welsh villages which no-one cares about Its either full of boring old people talking slowly about the "good old days" or mass of unnecessarily aggresive chavs wheeling around the same pushchair they sat in 15 years ago If you dont think its like either of those groups then you fall into one of those groups
