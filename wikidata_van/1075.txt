Werner Mölders old unit, Jagdgeschwader 51, was christened "Mölders" in his honour, on 22 ;November 1941, only hours after his death Its members were entitled to wear the "Mölders" His death, however, was also put to other uses Shortly after Mölders died, the British dropped over Germany The so called Möldersbrief Mölders-letter was copy of correspondence supposedly written by Mölders to the of In this letter, he expressed his strong belief in and stated that, especially in the face of death, many supporters of National Socialism still find strength and courage with Catholicism Mölders premature death, just shortly after own suicide, was too great an opportunity for the chief of the British in the PWE to ignore His idea was to use Mölders popularity in Germany, distributing letter thus creating the assumption that Mölders strong belief led him to oppose the Nazi regime in Germany The letter was extremely well conceived It did not bluntly call for opposition against the state It never even mentioned the National Socialists by name but rather used metaphors like "the godless" Nevertheless every German reader knew what was meant <ref>Hagena 2008, pp 67–68 </ref> The letter caused stir in the upper echelons of the Nazi regime In his diaries, assumed that someone in the German Catholic church organization wrote, and distributed, the letter bounty of 100,000 posted by the

German armed forces in the post-war cultural, political and social setting In 1998, on the occasion of the 61st Anniversary of the bombing of the Spanish town of during the Spanish Civil War, the decided that members of the Condor Legion, such as Mölders, should "no longer be honoured" <ref name "Obermaier&Held p36"/><ref>Hagena 2008, </ref> In 2005, the German Ministry of Defence decided to remove the name "Mölders" from the JG 74 The decision was confirmed on 11 ;March 2005 ;by the Federal Minister of Defence and at 10:00 ;the flags and cufftitles were removed <ref>Hagena 2008, 132 </ref> Mölders supporters challenged the ruling, and pointed out that Mölders had been posted to Spain well after the <ref name "Weal 2006, 120"/> They pointed to his equivocal political attitude towards National Socialism and his unequivocal moral commitment to Catholicism Not only did he have Catholic religious marriage ceremony but Klawitter, regarded by the Third Reich as politically "unreliable," had performed the ceremony Furthermore, Mölders had joined the Catholic youth organisation Bund Neudeutschland Union for New Germany on ;October 1925 ;and had been youth leader of the organization from 1929 ;to 1931 The Third Reich clearly had considered the Bund Neudeutschland as threat: The The Peoples Observer, the official newspaper of the party had reported on 26 ;January 1938 ;that the Bund had been outlawed for its proven subversive activities against the Reich, based on the Verordnung des Reichspräsidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat Imperial Presidential Decree for the Protection of People and State of 28 ;February 1933 <ref>Hagena 2008, 56 </ref> Despite petitions from politicians and high-ranking active and retired servicemen, among them and the MGFA noted that Mölders membership in the Bund Neudeutschland did not provide sufficient evidence of his having been critical of the regime, but rather showed the contrary and concluded that it was questionable whether Mölders had distanced himself enough from National Socialism before his death in 1941 Consequently, the decision remained in force <ref>Hagena 2008, 138 </ref><ref>Kaplan 2007, 51 </ref> Other evidence has surfaced illustrating both Mölders ambiguous relationship with the National Socialist regime Mölders may have been in contact with who was highly critical of the Nazi regime Von Galen publicly criticized the regime for the tactics and the deportation and of the mentally ill According to the diary kept by Heinrich Portmann, von Galens secretary and chaplain, Mölders threatened to return his awards if von Galens euthanasia accusation turned out to be true Furthermore, Portmann stated that Hitler had asked Mölders during the presentation of the Diamonds to the Knights Cross if there was anything he wished for Mölders reportedly responded, "Please leave the bishop of Münster alone Hitler assured him that "Yes, nothing will happen to the bishop of Münster The MGFA concluded in 2005 ;that this story was most likely false The MGFA revised its position again on 28 ;June 2007, concluding that there had been contact between Mölders and von Galen <ref>Hagena 2008, pp 60–64 </ref> Evidence also demonstrates Mölders propensity to value friendships over political expediency According to Viktor Mölders, his brother had saved Georg Küch—one of Werner Mölders closest friends, who had been classified as by the —from death in the concentration camps Mölders and Küchs friendship dated to their school days at the Saldria-Gymnasium in Brandenburg an der Havel Küchs mother, Alice née Siegel, was of Jewish birth <ref>Hagena 2008, 73 </ref> Küchs father, Richard Küch, owned and operated in Brandenburg Georg, himself pharmacy student, was expelled from university under the Nuremberg Laws, just two semesters shy of his graduation In 1940, Richard Küch fell ill, and owning and operating the pharmacy became bureaucratic problem for the family Georg Küch contacted his friend Mölders in mid-February 1941, asking for help Werner Mölders immediately responded to Küch on 16 ;February 1941, stating that he had taken care of the matter and asking Küch not to pursue the issue on his own When Richard Küch died in June 1941, his wife was able to sell the pharmacy for fair market value Normally, since she was Jewish, it would have been confiscated She also remained exempt from wearing the detested until late 1943 She was then taken to the concentration camp, where she worked as cook Georg Küch, Alice Küch, and Georgs sister Friedel survived the Friedel Küch
