Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air Relative humidity is defined as the ratio of the of in of to the saturated of water vapor at prescribed Humidity may also be expressed as specific humidity Relative humidity is an important used in Humidity indicates the likelihood of or High humidity makes people feel hotter outside in the summer because it reduces the effectiveness of to cool the body by reducing the of perspiration from the skin This effect is calculated in table Absolute humidity is the quantity of water in particular volume of air most common units are grams per cubic meter, although any mass unit and any volume unit could be used Pounds per cubic foot is common in the and occasionally even other units mixing the Imperial and metric systems are used If all the water in one of air were condensed into container, the container could be weighed to determine absolute humidity The amount of vapor in that cube of air is the absolute humidity of that cubic meter of air More technically, absolute humidity is the mass of water vapor, <math> m_w </math>, per cubic meter of air, <math> V_a </math>: :<math> AH m_w \over V_a </math> Absolute humidity ranges from grams per cubic meter in dry air to 30 grams per cubic meter 03 ounce per cubic foot when the vapour is saturated at 30 °C http://www britannica com/eb/article-53259/climate#292984 hook See also http://www tis-gdv de/tis_e/misc/klima htm Absolute Humidity table The absolute humidity changes as air changes This is very inconvenient for calculations, for s, where can vary considerably As result, absolute humidity is generally defined in chemical engineering as mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air, also known as the mass mixing ratio see below which is much more rigorous for heat and mass balance calculations Mass of water per unit volume as in the equation above would then be defined as volumetric humidity Because of the potential confusion, BS 1339 revised 2002 suggests avoiding the term "absolute humidity" Units should always be carefully checked Most humidity charts are given in g/kg or kg/kg, but any mass units may be used The engineering of physical and thermodynamic properties of gas-vapor mixtures is named Mixing or humidity ratio is expressed as ratio of water vapour mass, <math> m_w </math>, per kilogram of dry air, <math> m_d </math>, at given pressure The colloquial term moisture content is also used instead of mixing/humidity ratio Humidity ratio is standard axis on psychrometric charts, and is useful parameter in calculations because it does not change with temperature except when the air cools below dewpoint That ratio can be given as: :<math> MRi m_w \over m_d </math> Mixing ratio can also be expressed with the of water vapor<ref> Cite web url http://amsglossary allenpress com/glossary/search?id mixing-ratio1 work Glossary of Meteorology title Mixing ratio publisher accessdate 2009-08-02 </ref> :<math> MRi \delta p_w \over p_a p_w </math> where :<math>\delta 62197</math> is the ratio of molecular weights of water vapour and dry air :<math>p_w </math> partial pressure of water vapor in moist air :<math>p_a </math>atmospheric pressure of moist air Technically speaking, this is as it is the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air So it is expressed as Kg/Kg However, the mass of water vapor is much less than the value of the mass of dry air and most commonly meteorologists use /Kg which is <math>10^ -3 </math> Kg/Kg <ref> Cite web url http://www wmo int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/meetings/Upper-Air/ET-IOC-3/Doc5 pps#374,7,Data%20processing%20procedure work E- Evaluation title Data processing procedure author publisher accessdate 2009-08-02 </ref> Main Relative humidity Relative humidity is defined as the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor in eous mixture of air and water vapor to the saturated vapor pressure of water at given temperature Relative humidity is expressed as percentage and is calculated in the following manner: <math> RH p_ \rm H_2O \over p^*_ \rm H_2O \times 100% </math> where :<math> p_ \rm H_2O </math> is the of water vapor in the gas mixture; :<math> p^*_ \rm H_2O </math> is the of water at the temperature of the gas mixture; and :<math> RH_ \,_\, </math> is the relative humidity of the gas mixture being considered Relative humidity is often mentioned in and reports, as it is an indicator of the likelihood of dew, or fog In hot summer it also increases the to and other by hindering the of from the skin as the relative humidity rises For example, if it was 80 degrees, with relative humidity of approximately 75%, it would feel about 84 degrees Specific humidity is the ratio of water vapor to air including water vapor and dry air in particular mass Specific humidity ratio is expressed as ratio of kilograms of water vapor, <math> m_w </math>, per kilogram of air including water vapor <math> m_t </math> That ratio can be shown as: :<math> SH m_w \over m_t </math> Specific humidity is related to mixing ratio and vice versa by: :<math> SH MR \over 1+MR </math> :<math> MR SH \over 1-SH </math> Humidity is measure of the amount of water vapor dissolved in the air, not including any liquid water or ice falling through the air For to form, and to start, the air doesnt have to reach 100% relative humidity at the Earths surface, but only where the clouds and raindrops form This normally occurs when the air rises and cools Typically, rain falls into air with less than saturated humidity Some water from the rain may evaporate into the air as it falls, increasing the humidity, but not necessarily enough to raise the humidity to 100% It is even possible for rain falling through warm, humid air to be cold enough to lower the air temperature to the thus condensing water vapor out of the air Although that would indeed raise the to 100%, the water lost from the air as dew would also lower the Associated with relative humidity is If the dew point is below freezing, it is referred to as the frost point Dew point is the at which water vapor saturates from an air mass into liquid or solid usually forming or Dew point normally occurs when mass of air has relative humidity of 100% This happens in the as result of cooling through number of different processes is device used for measuring the humidity of the air There are various devices used to measure and regulate humidity device used to measure humidity is called psychrometer or is used to regulate the humidity of building with de-humidifier These can be analogous to and for temperature control Humidity is also measured on global scale using remotely placed These satellites are able to detect the concentration of water in the at altitudes between and 12 kilometers Satellites that can measure water vapor have sensors that are sensitive to Water vapor specifically absorbs and re-radiates radiation in this spectral band Satellite water vapor imagery plays an important role in monitoring climate conditions like the formation of thunderstorms and in the development of future main Density of air Humid air is less dense than dry air because molecule of water 18 is less massive than molecule of 28 and molecule of 32 About 78% of the molecules in dry air are nitrogen N<sub>2</sub> Another 21% of the molecules in dry air are oxygen O<sub>2</sub> The final 1% of dry air is mixture of other gases For any gas, at given temperature and pressure, the number of molecules present is constant for particular volume see So when water molecules vapor are introduced to the dry air, the number of air molecules must reduce by the same number in given volume, without the pressure or temperature increasing Hence the mass per unit volume of the gas its density decreases discovered this phenomenon and wrote about it in his book <ref name "optics"> cite book author Newton, Isaac url http://books google com/books?id iTpXLrPR2TQC&printsec frontcover&dq isaac+newton+optics publisher Dover title Opticks date 1704 </ref> The human body sheds heat by combination of evaporation of perspiration, in the surrounding air, and Under conditions of high humidity, the evaporation of sweat from the skin is decreased and the bodys efforts to maintain an acceptable body temperature may be significantly impaired Also, if the atmosphere is as warm as or warmer than the skin during times of high humidity, brought to the body surface cannot shed heat by conduction to the air, and condition called results With so much blood going to the external surface of the body, relatively less goes to the active s, the and other internal declines and occurs sooner than it would otherwise Alertness and mental capacity also may be affected This resulting condition is called heat stroke or Humans control their body temperature mainly by and The cites the Standard 55-1992 Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy, which recommends keeping relative humidity between 30% and 60%, with below 50% preferred to control At high humidity sweating is less effective so we feel hotter;
