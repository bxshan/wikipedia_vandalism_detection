In cis-trans isomerism or geometric isomerism or configuration isomerism or E-Z isomerism is form of describing the orientation of within molecule In general, such isomers contain s, which cannot rotate, but they can also arise from ring structures, wherein the rotation of bonds is greatly restricted Cis and trans occur both in organic molecules and in inorganic coordination complexes THEO< BE HAPPY LOVE YOU LOADS XXX <3
