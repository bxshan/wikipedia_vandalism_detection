article detailing the statements On the 14th of June 1947 William "Mac" Brazel noticed some strange clusters of debris while working on the Foster homestead, where he was foreman, some convert 30 mi -1 north of Roswell This exact date or "about three weeks" before July is point of contention<ref>If the object Brazel found was in fact first seen on or about June 14th, many scenarios suggested by authors suggesting the recovery of an alien craft would not be plausible, as most of these scenarios offer witness statements from those who saw or heard an object fall to earth in the early days of July The issue of an exact date is not problem for those who suggest Project Mogul device was the source of the debris as the most frequently cited balloon train source of the debris flew in early June, so any debris found afterwards could be accounted for </ref> but is repeated in several initial accounts, in particular the stories that quote Brazel and in telex sent few hours after the story
