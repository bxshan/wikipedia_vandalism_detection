Johnson had served only 14 months following before being elected in 1964 to full term As result, it was widely assumed when 1968 began that President Johnson would run for another term, and that he would have little trouble winning the Democratic nomination Despite the growing opposition to Johnsons policies in Vietnam, it appeared no prominent Democratic candidate was prepared to run against sitting President of his own party Even of an outspoken critic of Johnsons policies with large base of support, initially refused to run against Johnson in the primaries In time, only Senator of proved willing to challenge Johnson openly Running as an antiwar candidate in the McCarthy hoped to pressure the Democrats into publicly opposing the Vietnam War Since New Hampshire was the first presidential primary of 1968, McCarthy poured most of his limited resources into the state He was boosted by thousands of young college students led by youth coordinator who shaved their beards and cut their hair to be "Clean for Gene These students organized get-out-the-vote drives, rang doorbells and distributed McCarthy buttons and leaflets, and worked hard in New Hampshire for McCarthy On March 12, McCarthy won 42% of the primary vote to Johnsons 49%, an amazingly strong showing for such challenger, and one which gave McCarthys campaign legitimacy and momentum The momentum ended, however, when Senator Kennedy announced his candidacy four days later, on March 16, as McCarthy supporters cried betrayal and vowed to defeat Kennedy an influential liberal journalist and McCarthy supporter, bitterly criticized Kennedy for waiting to enter the primaries until McCarthy had shown that Johnson was vulnerable Kempton wrote that Kennedy "was like man who comes down from the hills after the battle and shoots the wounded Thereafter McCarthy and Kennedy would engage in an increasingly bitter series of state primaries; although Kennedy won most of the primaries, he could never shake McCarthy and his devoted following of antiwar activists, which included many celebrities such as and On March 31, 1968, following the New Hampshire primary and Kennedys entry into the election, the President addressed the nation in televised speech in which he announced that he was suspending all bombing of North Vietnam in favor of peace talks Johnson concluded his speech and startled the nation by announcing "With Americas sons in the fields far away, with Americas future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the worlds hopes for peace in the balance every day, do not believe that should devote an hour or day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office--the Presidency of your country Accordingly, shall not seek, and will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President Not discussed publicly at the time was Johnsons concern he might not survive another term—Johnsons health was poor, and he had suffered serious in 1955 while serving in the Senate Bleak political forecasts also contributed to Johnsons withdrawal: internal polling by Johnsons campaign in the next state to hold primary election, showed the President trailing badly With Johnsons withdrawal, the Democratic Party quickly split into four factions, each of which distrusted the other three The first faction comprised labor unions and big-city party bosses led by Mayor This group had traditionally controlled the Democratic Party since the days of President and they feared their loss of control over the party After Johnsons withdrawal this group rallied to support Johnsons Vice President; it was also believed that President Johnson himself was covertly supporting Humphrey, despite his public claims of neutrality The second faction, which rallied behind Senator McCarthy, was composed of college students, intellectuals, and upper-middle-class whites who had been the early activists against the war in Vietnam; they perceived themselves as the future of the Democratic Party The third group was primarily composed of and other racial and ethnic minorities as well as several antiwar groups; these groups rallied behind Senator Robert Kennedy The fourth group consisted of conservative white Southern Democrats, or "" Some members of this group probably older ones remembering the positive impact upon rural areas supported Vice President Humphrey, but many of them would rally behind and the Alabama governors third-party campaign in the general election Since the Vietnam War had become the major issue that was dividing the Democratic Party, and Johnson had come to symbolize the war for many liberal Democrats, Johnson believed that he could not win the nomination without major struggle, and that he would probably lose the election in November to the Republicans However, by withdrawing from the race he could avoid the stigma of defeat, and he could keep control of the party machinery by giving the nomination to Humphrey, who had been loyal Vice President As the year developed, it also became clear that Johnson believed he could secure his place in the history books by ending the war before the election in November, thus giving Humphrey the boost he would need to win <ref>Dallek 1998 Woods 2006 Gould 1993 </ref> After Johnsons withdrawal, announced his candidacy Kennedy was successful in four primaries and McCarthy five;

it was the first time that Kennedy had lost general election After Kennedys defeat in Oregon, the California primary was seen as crucial to both Kennedy and McCarthy McCarthy stumped the states many colleges and universities, where he was treated as hero for being the first presidential candidate to oppose the war Kennedy campaigned in the and of the states larger cities, where he was mobbed by enthusiastic supporters Kennedy and McCarthy engaged in television debate few days before the primary; it was generally considered draw On June Kennedy narrowly defeated McCarthy in California, 46%–42% However, McCarthy refused to withdraw from the race and made it clear that he would contest Kennedy in the upcoming primary, where McCarthy had much support from antiwar activists in New York City The New York primary quickly became moot point, however, for in the early morning of June 5, shortly after midnight;

the protestors had also yelled verbal insults at the police, calling them "pigs" and other The antiwar riots divided the Democratic Partys base, as some sympathized with the police and condemned the protestors, while some liberal Democrats supported the protestors and were outraged by the actions of the Chicago police Meanwhile, the convention itself was marred by the strong-arm tactics of Chicagos mayor who was seen on television angrily cursing Senator of who made speech at the convention denouncing the excesses of the Chicago police in the riots In the end, the nomination itself was anticlimactic, with Vice President Humphrey handily beating McCarthy and McGovern on the first ballot After the delegates nominated Humphrey, the convention then turned to selecting vice president The main candidates for this position were Senator Senator Senator Governor Mayor and former Deputy Secretary of Defense Former Governor and Ambassador had been considered earlier in the process along with Republican Governor Ted Kennedy was Humphreys first choice but the senator turned him down After narrowing it down to Senator Muskie and Senator Harris, Vice President Humphrey chose Muskie, moderate and from for the nomination The convention complied with the request and nominated Senator of as Humphreys running mate However, the tragedy of the antiwar riots crippled Humphreys campaign from the start, and it never fully recovered <ref>White, pgs 377–378;

would give those states to Humphrey and, by extension, boost his own chances of denying both opponents an Electoral College majority The "southern strategy" would prove more effective in subsequent elections and would become staple of Republican presidential campaigns Nixons campaign was also carefully managed and controlled He often held "town hall" type meetings in cities he visited, where he answered questions from voters that had been screened in advance by his aides Since he was well behind Nixon in the polls as the campaign began, Humphrey opted for slashing, fighting campaign style He

the Democratic Party was obviously the majority party During that time period, the Democrats won seven presidential elections The election of 1968 reversed the situation completely From 1969 to 2009, the Republican Party was undoubtedly the majority party During that time period, the Republicans also won seven presidential elections Many historians believe the reason for the Democratic Partys decline in strength was the bitter split within the party created by debates about civil rights, the Vietnam War and other "culture wars" of the 1960s Notably, most white Southern Democrats and especially their children became Republicans in the next two decades, creating fundamental shift of political power in the nation which favored the GOP From 1968 to 2008 only two Democrats served as President of the United States, and they were both native Southerners of Georgia and of Arkansas Not until 2008 did Northern Democrat, win presidential election Another important result of the 1968 election was that it led to several reforms in how the Democratic Party chose its presidential nominees In 1969, the adopted set of rules for the states to follow in selecting convention delegates These rules reduced the influence of party leaders on the nominating process and provided greater representation for minorities, women, and youth The reforms led most states to adopt laws requiring primary elections, instead of party leaders, to choose delegates After 1968 the only way to win the partys presidential nomination was through the primary process; Humphrey turned out to be the last
