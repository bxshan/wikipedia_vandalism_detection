!Moson !My friend Rick S, Electronic Engineer !Strictly decorative, Mosons are visible most anywhere that the sun is screened through clouds, mountain ranges at sunset, even ocean water of fairly good clarity These rays are really photons, screened as per above Derived from the Bible color pictures of Moses receiving tablets, thus surrounded by rays from the heavens "Mosons"
