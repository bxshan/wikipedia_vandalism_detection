The Egyptians celebrated variety of religious festivals Most were annual, tied to one or more specific days of the year, but some took place at longer intervals or on irregular occasions Some, such as the celebration of the new year, took place across the country, but most were celebrated only locally, at specific temple Temple festivals usually involved procession carrying the gods image out of the sanctuary in model barque to visit other significant sites, such as the temple of related deity Commoners celebrated these events along with the priesthood, gathering to watch the procession and sometimes receiving portions of the unusually large offerings given to the gods on these occasions Other festivals were part of the rituals of kingship rather than the cult of deity; these included coronation ceremonies and the ritual renewal of the pharaohs strength which took place periodically during his reign <ref>Shafer 1997 pp 25â€“28</ref>
