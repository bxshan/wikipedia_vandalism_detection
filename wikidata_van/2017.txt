rootkit is system that consists of one or more designed to obscure the fact that system has been compromised Contrary to what its name may imply, rootkit does not grant user administrator privileges, as it requires prior access to execute and tamper with system files and processes An attacker may use rootkit to replace vital system executables, which may then be used to hide processes and files the attacker has installed, along with the presence of the rootkit Access to the hardware, the reset switch, is rarely required, as rootkit is intended to seize control of the operating system Typically, rootkits act to obscure their presence on the system through subversion or evasion of standard operating system scan and surveillance mechanisms such as anti-virus or anti-spyware scan Often, they are as well, thus fooling users into believing they are safe to run on their systems Techniques used to accomplish this can include concealing running processes from monitoring programs, or hiding files or system data from the <ref> cite web url http://www usenix org/publications/login/1999-9/features/rootkits html title invisible intruders: rootkits in practice date 16 November 1999 author Brumley, David publisher </ref> Rootkits may also install "back door" in system by replacing the login mechanism such as /bin/login with an executable that accepts secret login combination, which, in turn, allows an attacker to access the system, regardless of the changes to the actual accounts on the system Detection achieved computing firmware comparing hash values whitelist expected values, extending hash value TPM configuration registers, later compared whitelist expected values Code performs hash, compare, and/or extend operations must itself The notion immutable root-of-trust, if implementable, ensures compromise at most fundamental layer method detection using TPM described https://www trustedcomputinggroup org/news/Industry_Data/Whitepaper_Rootkit_Strom_v3 pdf format PDF Stopping at Network Edge January 2007 accessdate 2008-07-11 Direct removal of rootkit may be impractical Even if the type and nature of the rootkit are known, the required time and effort by system administrator with the necessary skills or experience may exceed the required time to re-install the operating system Re-installation time can be greatly reduced by modern and the source image may have been generated with necessary hardware drivers and software applications already installed, further reducing the incentive to repair the existing installation
