Cameron describes himself as complete f*****g cu*t who surrounds himself with his eton chums and will quite happily obliterate the working classes if he ever god forbid gets to power He only says what the public want to hear and will do turn as soon as the point in question becomes unpopular Whatever has gone wrong in the UK he says he would have done it in exactly the opposite way to what happened, even though this would have gone against his many forgotten promises to the public to try and get in power
