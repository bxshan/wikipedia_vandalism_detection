McGuinness began writing music at the age of 15 His first release, The Early Learnings Of Eugene McGuinness, was released on August 2007, on sublabel Although the was less than half an hour long, it received praise from critics while not selling many copies reviewer Chris White called it "brimful with ideas" and stated that McGuinness voice on the record "soars euphorically and coos playfully with equal aplomb" <ref name "bbc-el" /> gave the EP rating of 9/10, saying "McGuinness has way with words thats quite remarkable" <ref name "DiS-el" /> However, despite gaining the backing of its critics, it failed to chart in the United Kingdom Following the good response of Learnings, he went on to release his debut album, under the Domino label on 13 October 2008 Unlike the last release, Eugene McGuinness is full-length album with twelve tracks The album received mixed reviews from critics; Pitchfork citing lack of progress in his songwriting <ref>http://pitchfork com/reviews/albums/13100-eugene-mcguinness/</ref> An journalist called the album "busily eclectic but can make no great claims to originality", while Drowned in Sound labelled it "a bold and confident piece of brilliance, equally off kilter as it is tenderly raw" The BBC said that the album "runs the formative gamut of angsty, carefree, happy-sad, hormone-fuelled, late-teens emotions with solipsistic disregard for any feelings but his own" <ref name "BBC-emg" />
