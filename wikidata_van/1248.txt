about 1910 Candlepin bowling was developed in 1880 in by local bowling center owner, Justin White some years before both the standardization of the sport in 1895, and the invention of Today the game is enjoyed in many diverse places such as California and Germany in addition to New England <ref>http://www ficcosbowl com/about_candlepin html</ref> As in other forms of bowling, the players roll balls down wooden pathway lane to knock down as many pins as possible The main differences between candlepin bowling and the predominant style are that each player uses three balls per frame see below the balls are much smaller 11 43 ;cm, or 5" diameter and do not have holes, the downed pins known as wood are not cleared away between balls during players turn, and the pins are thinner, and thus harder to knock down Because of these differences, scoring points is considerably more difficult than in ten-pin bowling, and the highest officially sanctioned undisputed score ever recorded is 245 out of possible 300 points The highest officially sanctioned but disputed score is 265 <ref> cite web url http://www bowlcandlepin com/Records htm title ICBA Records publisher Bowlcandlepin com date accessdate 2009-07-26 </ref> fallen pins are not cleared away between balls during players turn candlepin bowling lane, almost identical to tenpin bowling lane, has an approach area of some to meters 14 to 16 ;ft long for the player to bowl from, and then the lane proper, maple surface approximately 05 meters 41 ;in wide, bounded on either side by gutter or "channel", or trough The lane is separated from approach area by foul line, which must not be crossed by players At the far end of the lane, are the pins 18 meters 60 from the foul line to the center of the headpin or pin #1 placed by machine called which occupies space both above and behind the pins Unlike tenpin lane, which has level surface all the way from the near end of the lanes approach to the end of the lanebed, metal pin plate forms the "pindeck" area of the candlepin lane, and is very slightly depressed below the lanebed forward of it Behind the pindeck area of the lane is well-depressed "pit" area for knocked-over pins and balls to fall into, and curtain behind this to gently stop the pins and balls from going any further Generally there is seating behind the approach area for teammates and spectators, and containing small table to hold scorepads The Candlepins themselves are 15 75" 400 ;mm tall, have cylindrical shape which tapers equally towards each end and therefore having no distinct "top" or "bottom" end, unlike tenpin giving them an overall appearance somewhat like that of candle, and have maximum weight of 13 ;kg ;lb oz apiece Candlepin bowling uses the same numbering system and shape for the formation within the ten candlepins are set, as the tenpin sport does Also, as in ten-pin bowling, due to the spacing of the pins 12", or 30 ;cm, center to center it is impossible for the ball to strike every one However, while in ten-pin well-placed ball usually between the front pin and one of its nearest neighbors may knock down all ten pins from the chain reaction of pin hitting pin strike in candlepin the smaller thickness of the pins makes throwing strike extremely difficult In general, forcefully thrown ball hitting near the center of the pins will result in many pins being knocked down, but not all In order to count, the pin must be knocked over entirely; in unlucky circumstances, pin may wobble furiously, or, even more frustratingly, be "kicked" to the side by several inches, yet come to rest upright, thus not being scored and not be reset to its original position for any throws that remain, though it may of course still be knocked over by subsequent balls In addition to the normal foul line for the bowler themselves, there is line 10 feet 05 down the lane from the foul line; this is the lob line, and the ball must first contact the lane at point on the bowlers side of it Violation of this rule constitutes lob and any pins knocked down by such ball do not count, and such pins are not reset if the lobbed ball was not the third and last shot for that player in that box Also, third line, centered 61 ;cm 24 ;in front of the head pin number-1 pin spot is the dead wood line, which defines the maximum forward limit that any toppled pins "dead wood" can occupy and still be legally playable This lane specification essentially results in the presence of three foul lines, more than in any other bowling sport One unique feature of the candlepin sport is that fallen pins, usually called dead wood, are not removed from the pin deck area between balls, unlike either the tenpin or duckpin bowling sports depending on where the fallen pins are located and their angle at rest as all fallen pins must be stationary before delivering the next ball the dead wood can be major help, or obstacle, in trying to knock down every single standing pin for either spare or "ten-box" score in completing round The ball used in candlepins has maximum weight of ;kg ;lb oz and has maximum diameter of 11 43 ;cm 4-1/2 ;inches making it the smallest bowling ball of any North American bowling sport <ref name "rules" /> The nearly identical weight of the ball, when compared to that of just one candlepin, tends to cause rapidly-delivered balls to sometimes bounce at random when impacting full rack of pins on the first delivery of frame, and sometimes when hitting downed "dead wood" pins on subsequent deliveries game of candlepin bowling, often called string in New England, is divided into ten rounds, each of these rounds being most commonly referred to as box, rather than "frame" as in ten-pin bowling In each normal box, player is given up to three opportunities to knock down as many pins as possible In the final box, three balls are rolled regardless of the pincount, meaning three strikes can be scored in the 10th frame In each of the first nine boxes, play proceeds as follows: The first player bowls their first ball at the pins Whatever pins are knocked down are counted and scored Then the player rolls second and third ball at any remaining targets In the event that all ten pins were knocked down with the first ball strike the player receives ten points plus the count on the next two rolls, the pins are cleared, new set placed, and play passes to the next competitor If all ten pins were knocked down with two balls spare the player receives 10 points plus the count of the next ball, pins are cleared and reset, and play passes to the next competitor If all three balls are needed to knock all the pins down, the score for that frame is simply 10 In the tenth box, play is similar, except that player scoring strike is granted two additional balls, scoring spare earns one additional ball Three balls are rolled in the tenth frame regardless <ref> http://candlepinbowling com/Rules pdf Official ICBA Rulebook </ref> foul scored by "F" refers to ball that rolls into the gutter and then strikes wood felled pins resting on the pin deck behind the dead wood line or standing pin, ball that touches neither the approach or lane before the lob line, or roll made by bowler crossing over the foot foul line Special scoring comes into play foul always scores zero but player may reset the pins provided it is the first throw in box or all the preceding balls scored "F" or Therefore, if on the first ball there is foul or zero—it is possible to keep the ball on the lane yet miss all ten pins standing in their normal position—and on second ball foul, the pins may be reset, attempting to knock down fresh set of 10 pins, but not score strike or spare foul in the first box but with knocking down all ten pins in the rerack, it is spare, otherwise third ball is thrown to finish out the box Fouling all three attempts scores zero Knocking down at least one pin on the first ball, the rack can not be reset because of foul Those pins felled by foul ball ball jumping out of the channel, lobbed ball, ball delivered by bowler over the foot foul line --whether standing, playable wood, or pins in the channel—remain down and reduce the maximum number of pins to be counted for the box Therefore, with six pins remaining standing with foul on the next ball, managing to knock down the remaining six with the foul ball, the frame is over, scoring for that frame Knocking down some of the remaining pins means third ball is rolled may shoot for the pins left standing and only add that total to the four felled in the first ball ex thus, unadjusted score: "X", but true score: The same holds true for rolling two good balls and fouling in the third attempt The frame is over and only the pins felled in the first two attempts are recorded for the score for that box <ref> http://candlepinbowling com/Rules htm#FOUL%20RULES Official ICBA Foul Rules </ref> While some candlepin alleys have automated scoring systems, and thus know when to clear and reset pins, other alleys, especially older ones have button, or floor-mounted foot pedal switch, which players must press to manually initiate the clearing and resetting of pins Automatic pinsetters were introduced in the late 1940s; prior to this, as with ten-pin, pins were set by workers called "pinboys" In league play, bowler will bowl five boxes at time, called half
