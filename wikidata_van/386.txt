unreferenced date June 2009 bot yes Otheruses in also known as the Mosque of Uqba, city of column in is vertical structural element that transmits, through the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below For the purpose of or columns may be designed to resist lateral forces Other are often termed "columns" because of the similar stress conditions Columns are frequently used to support or es on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest In architecture "column" refers to such structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features column might also be decorative or triumphant feature but need not be supporting any structure statue on top In the architecture of as early as the architect made use of stone columns whose surface was carved to reflect the organic form of bundled reeds; in later Egyptian architecture faceted cylinders were also common Some of the most edfdfdclumns in the ancient world were those of especially the massive stone columns erected in They included double-bull structures in their capitals at Persepolis, measuring 70 ;× 70 meters was built by the king 524–486 BC Many of the ancient Persian columns are standing, some being more than 30 meters tall The impost or pier is the topmost member of column The bottom-most part of the arch, called the springing, rests on the impost Early columns were constructed of stone, some out of single piece of stone, usually by turning on lathe-like apparatus Single-piece columns are among the heaviest stones used in architecture Other stone columns are created out of multiple sections of stone, mortared or dry-fit together In many classical sites, sectioned columns were carved with center hole or depression so that they could be pegged together, using stone or metal pins The design of most classical columns incorporates the inclusion of slight outward curve in the sides plus reduction in diameter along the height of the column, so that the top is as little as 83% of the bottom diameter This reduction mimics the parallax effects which the eye expects to see, and tends to make columns look taller and straighter than they are while entasis adds to that effect Modern columns are constructed out of steel, poured or precast concrete, or brick They may then be clad in an architectural covering or veneer or left bare style Syria Mechanical_failure_modes As the axial load on perfectly straight slender column with elastic material properties is increased in magnitude, this ideal column passes through three states: stable equilibrium, neutral equilibrium, and instability The straight column under load is in stable equilibrium if lateral force, applied between the two ends of the column, produces small lateral deflection which disappears and the column returns to its straight form when the lateral force is removed If the column load is gradually increased, condition is reached in which the straight form of equilibrium becomes so-called neutral equilibrium, and small lateral force will produce deflection that does not disappear and the column remains in this slightly bent form when the lateral force is removed The load at which neutral equilibrium of column is reached is called the critical or load The state of instability is reached when slight increase of the column load causes uncontrollably growing lateral deflections leading to complete collapse For an axially loaded straight column with any end support conditions, the equation of static equilibrium, in the form of differential equation, can be solved for the deflected shape and critical load of the column With hinged, fixed or free end support conditions the deflected shape in neutral equilibrium of an initially straight column with uniform cross section throughout its length always follows partial or composite sinusoidal curve shape, and the critical load is given by <math>f_ cr \equiv\frac \pi^2\textit I_ min ^2 \qquad </math> where of elasticity of the material, I<sub>min</sub> the minimal moment of inertia of the cross section, and actual length of the column between its two end supports variant of is given by <math>f_ cr \equiv\frac \pi^ E_T \frac KL \qquad </math> where of gyration of column cross-section which is equal to the square root of I/A ratio of the longest half wave to the actual column length, and KL effective length length of an equivalent hinged-hinged column From Equation it can be noted that the buckling strength of column is inversely proportional to the square of its length When the critical stress, F<sub>cr</sub> F<sub>cr</sub> P<sub>cr</sub>/A, where cross-sectional area of the column is greater than the proportional limit of the material, the column is experiencing inelastic buckling Since at this stress the slope of the materials stress-strain curve, E<sub>t</sub> called the modulus is smaller than that below the proportional limit, the critical load at inelastic buckling is reduced More complex formulas and procedures apply for such cases, but in its simplest form the critical buckling load formula is given as Equation <math>f_ cr \equiv F_y -\frac F^ 4\pi^ \left \frac KL r^2 \right \qquad </math> where E<sub>t</sub> tangent modulus at the stress F<sub>cr</sub> column with cross section that lacks symmetry may suffer torsional buckling sudden twisting before, or in combination with, lateral buckling The presence of the twisting deformations renders both theoretical analyses and practical designs rather complex Eccentricity of the load, or imperfections such as initial crookedness, decreases column strength If the axial load on the column is not concentric, that is, its line of action is not precisely coincident with the centroidal axis of the column, the column is characterized as eccentrically loaded The eccentricity of the load, or an initial curvature, subjects the column to immediate bending The increased stresses due to the combined axial-plus-flexural stresses result in reduced load-carrying ability When column is too long to be built or transported in one piece, it has to be extended or spliced at the construction site reinforced concrete column is extended by having the steel reinforcing bars protrude few inches or feet above the top of the concrete, then placing the next level of reinforcing bars to overlap, and pouring the concrete of the next level steel column is extended by welding or bolting splice plates on the flanges and webs or walls of the columns to provide few inches or feet of load transfer from the upper to the lower column section timber column is usually extended by the use of steel tube or wrapped-around sheet-metal plate bolted onto the two connecting timber sections column that carries the load down to foundation must have means to transfer the load without overstressing the foundation material Reinforced concrete and masonry columns are generally built directly on top of concrete foundations steel column, when seated on concrete foundation, must have base plate to spread the load over larger area and thereby reduce the bearing pressure The base plate is thick rectangular steel plate usually welded to the bottom end of the column main Classical order The author relying on the writings now lost of authors, tells us that the ancient believed that their Doric order developed from techniques for building in wood in which the earlier smoothed tree trunk was replaced by stone cylinder main Doric order The is the oldest and simplest of the classical orders It is composed of vertical that is wider at the bottom It generally has neither base nor detailed It is instead often topped with an inverted of shallow cone or cylindrical band of carvings It is often referred to as the masculine order because it is represented in the bottom level of the and the and was therefore considered to be able to hold more weight The height-to-thickness ratio is about 8:1 The shaft of Doric Column is always fluted The Greek Doric, developed in the western Dorian region of Greece, is the heaviest and most massive of the orders It rises from the stylobate without any base; it is from four to six times as tall as its diameter; it has twenty broad flutes; the capital consists simply of banded necking swelling out into smooth echinus which carries flat square abacus; the Doric entablature is also the heaviest, being about one-fourth the height column The Greek Doric order was not used after 100 until its “rediscovery” in the mid-eighteenth century main Tuscan order The also known as Roman Doric, is also simple design, the base and capital both being series of cylindrical disks of alternating diameter The shaft is almost never fluted The proportions vary, but are generally similar to Doric columns Height to width ratio is about 7:1 main Ionic order The column is considerably more complex than the Doric or Tuscan It usually has base and the shaft is often fluted it has grooves carved up its length On ALOHA the top is capital in the characteristic shape of called or scroll, at the four corners The height-to-thickness ratio is around 9:1 Due to the more refined proportions and scroll capitals, the Ionic column is sometimes associated with academic buildings main Corinthian order The is named for the Greek of to which it was connected in the period However, according to the architectural historian Vitruvius, the column was created by the sculptor probably an who drew leaves growing around votive basket In fact, the oldest known Corinthian capital was found in Bassae, dated at It is sometimes called the feminine order because it is on the top level of the Colosseum and holding up the least weight, and also has the slenderest ratio of thickness to height Height to width ratio is about 10:1 The draws its name from the capital being composite of the Ionic and Corinthian capitals The acanthus of the Corinthian column already has scroll-like element, so the distinction is sometimes subtle Generally the Composite is similar to the Corinthian in proportion and employment, often in the upper tiers of colonnades Height to width ratio is about 11:1 or 12:1 were inventions of architects in Europe They were not used in antiquity, but were called “Solomonic” by baroque architects because they were based on description of columns in the great of King in the Solomonic column begins on base and ends in capital, just like classical column, but the shaft twists around the usual parameters of column, producing dramatic, serpentine effect of movement The most famous use of Solomonic columns is in the designed by for in the commons Column
