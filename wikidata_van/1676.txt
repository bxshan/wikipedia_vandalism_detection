So The Gillmor Gang was today We started things off with nice talk about Rajeev Motwani and his contributions to the community That was nice Then Leo Laporte started talking about the Palm Pre, which launches today That part of the show, which turned as ugly as show can turn, is in the video clip embedded above The unedited audio file of the show is here, you can listen to the pre show banter and the first bit about Motwani before the train wreck ask Leo whether he bought the Pre or got it free and in advance of the launch, which think is relevant because Palm is being very picky about who they give them out to We were promised one but it wasn’t delivered We suspect our critical coverage may be the reason, one other blogger spoke to is in the same situation Many of the pre-launch reviews are overtly positive, and we’re comparing those reviews where the journalist got free Pre in advance of launch to the less cheerful ones written by people who had to pay for the device Getting high profile device in advance is huge advantage, and is conflict of interest that should be disclosed in our opinion But the catch is this as long as Palm sends out letter with the device asking for it back in week, it isn’t considered financial conflict of interest The fact that few people ever return them is rarely brought up Anyway, Leo lost it and shut down the show I’ve had lot of interactions with him and they’ve always been positive Or at least thought so wasn’t watching the video live during the show and really thought Leo was joking until the very end as did Steve Gillmor and Loren Feldman, who were chuckling in the video My “what are you going to do about it” comment doesn’t sound so great in hindsight But really did just think he was joking around We’re under so much scrutiny at TechCrunch read the last two paragraphs here that guess don’t always stop and think about the fact that most journalists are never questioned, and don’t react particularly well when they are We were once, for example, accused of conflict of interest when we wrote story about product and happened to be “friend” on Facebook with the PR person for the company So you could say I’ve had to develop thick skin when it comes to questions about conflicts of interest And don’t consider asking journalist to disclose if device he says he loves was given to him for free or not as being particularly trollish thing to do I’m bummed this has to be an issue on day that we’re all mourning the loss of such an important member of our community And I’m sad that my professional relationship with Leo is apparently over apologize to you, Leo didn’t mean to imply that you were being unethical just think that, given the story that’s brewing about favoritism at Palm, it was important to disclose whether you paid for that Pre, and/or got it in advance think I’ll go take Laguna for walk now and try this blogging thing again tomorrow know lot of you are going to be commenting strongly on this Comment moderation is going to be tight on this post, so keep it constructive
