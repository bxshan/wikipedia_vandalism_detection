The varying environmental lapse rates throughout the earths atmosphere are of critical importance in particularly within the They are used to determine if the of rising air will rise high enough for its water to condense to form s, and, having formed clouds, whether the air will continue to rise and form bigger shower clouds, and whether these clouds will get even bigger and form thunder clouds As unsaturated air rises, its temperature drops at the dry adiabatic rate The dew point also drops as result of decreasing air pressure but much more slowly, typically about nowrap −2 °C per 1,000 ;m If unsaturated air rises far enough, eventually its temperature will reach its dew point, and condensation will begin to form This altitude is known as the LCL when mechanical lift is present and the CCL absent mechanical lift, in which case, the parcel must be heated from below to its The will be somewhere within the layer bounded by these parameters The difference between the dry adiabatic lapse rate and the rate at which the dew point drops is around nowrap °C per 1,000 ;m Given difference in temperature and dew point readings on the ground, one can easily find the LCL by multiplying the difference by 125 m/°C If the environmental lapse rate is less than the moist adiabatic lapse rate, the air is absolutely stable rising air will cool faster than the surrounding air and lose This often happens in the early morning, when the air near the ground has cooled overnight Cloud formation in stable air is unlikely If the environmental lapse rate is between the moist and dry adiabatic lapse rates, the air is conditionally unstable an unsaturated parcel of air does not have sufficient buoyancy to rise to the LCL or CCL, and it is stable to weak vertical displacements in either direction If the parcel is saturated it is unstable and will rise to the LCL or CCL, and either be halted due to an of or if lifting continues, deep, moist convection DMC may ensue, as parcel rises to the LFC after which it enters the FCL and usually rises to the EL If the environmental lapse rate is larger than the dry adiabatic lapse rate, it has superadiabatic lapse rate, the air is absolutely unstable parcel of air will gain buoyancy as it rises both below and above the lifting condensation level or convective condensation level This often happens in the afternoon over many land masses In these conditions, the likelihood of showers or even is increased Meteorologists use to measure the environmental lapse rate and compare it to the predicted adiabatic lapse rate to forecast the likelihood that air will rise Charts of the environmental lapse rate are known as examples of which include and See also The difference in moist adiabatic lapse rate and the dry rate is the cause of phenomenon also known as "s" in parts of North America
