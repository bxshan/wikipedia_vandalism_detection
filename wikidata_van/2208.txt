Expert-subject Physics date November 2008 This the physical concept Beyond the Standard Model The theory of everything TOE is putative of that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena Initially, the term was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories For example, great-grandfather of &mdash; character from cycle of stories of 1960s &mdash; was known to work on the "General Theory of Everything" Physicist claims<ref> citation first John last Ellis journal Nature title Physics gets physical correspondence volume 415 year 2002

of nothing? volume 323 pages 595–598 year 1986 doi 10 1038/323595a0 </ref> Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of to describe theory that would unify or explain through single model the theories of all of nature There have been many theories of everything proposed by theoretical physicists over the last century, but none has been confirmed experimentally The primary problem in producing TOE is that the accepted theories of and are hard to combine Based on theoretical arguments from the 1990s, many physicists believe that 11-dimensional which is described in many sectors by in many other sectors by is the complete theory of everything, although there is no widespread consensus and M-theory is not completed theory but rather an approach for producing one famously suggested that could, if it knew the position and velocity of every particle at given time, along with the laws of nature, calculate the position of any particle at any other time: quote An intellect which at certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes Essai philosophique sur les probabilités, Introduction 1814 Although modern suggests that uncertainty is inescapable, unifying theory governing probabilistic assignments may nevertheless exist Since times, have speculated that the apparent diversity of appearances conceals an underlying unity, and thus that the list of forces might be short, indeed might contain only single entry For example, the of the 17th century posited that all forces could be ultimately reduced to between tiny solid particles <ref>e cite book first Steven last

early 20th centuries, it gradually became apparent that many common examples of forces—contact forces, —resulted from electrical interactions between the smallest particles of matter In the late 1920s, the new quantum mechanics showed that the between were examples of quantum electrical forces, justifying boast that "the underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of large

no other fundamental forces exist Prominent contributors were and most notably, many attempts by Einstein and his collaborators In his last years, Albert Einstein was intensely occupied in finding such unifying theory None of these attempts were successful <ref>Pais 1982 Ch 17 </ref> The search for unifying theory was interrupted by the discovery of the and nuclear forces, which could not be subsumed into either gravity or electromagnetism further hurdle was the acceptance that quantum mechanics had to be incorporated from the start, rather than emerging as consequence of deterministic unified theory, as Einstein had hoped Gravity and electromagnetism could always peacefully coexist as entries in list of Newtonian forces, but for many years it seemed that gravity could not even be incorporated into the quantum framework, let alone unified with the other fundamental forces For this reason, work on unification for much of the twentieth century, focused on understanding the three "quantum" forces: electromagnetism and the weak and strong forces The first two were in 1967–68 by and as the "electroweak" force <ref>e Weinberg 1993 Ch 5</ref> However, while the strong and electroweak forces peacefully coexist in the of particle physics, they remain distinct Several GUTs have been proposed to unify them Although the simplest GUTs have been experimentally ruled out, the general idea, especially when linked with remains strongly favored by the theoretical physics community <ref> There is one GUT not linked to super symmetry that has not been eliminated by experiment That is the four universe theory of George Ryazanov It has been tested once in lab at Hebrew University informally The results were reported to be positive But the test has not been repeated elsewhere See http://george-ryazanov com/book4/03-Physics_of_Unity html However Ryazanovs theory does involve Lorentz violation If the Fermi Glast project does not find Lorentz violation, this will be blow to the Ryazanov Theory </ref> In current mainstream physics, Theory of Everything would unify all the of nature, which are usually considered to be four in number: the the and the Because the weak force can transform from one kind into another, the TOE should yield deep understanding of the various different kinds of particles as well as the different forces The expected pattern of theories is: familytree/start familytree TOE TOE Theory of Everything familytree familytree REL GUT REL GUT familytree familytree QCD EWT QCD <br/> EWT <br /> familytree familytree WNF EMF WNF <br/> EMF <br/> familytree familytree EF MF EF MF familytree/end In addition to the forces listed here, modern might require an and also composed of fundamental particles outside the scheme of the standard model The existence of these has not been proven and there are alternative theories such as Electroweak unification is the electromagnetic and weak forces appear distinct at low energies because the particles carrying the weak force, the have mass of about 100 ;GeV, whereas the which carries the electromagnetic force, is massless At higher energies Ws and Zs can be easily and the unified nature of the force becomes apparent Grand unification is expected to work in similar way, but at energies of the order of <math>10^ 16 </math> GeV, far greater than could be reached by any possible Earth-based By analogy, unification of the GUT force with gravity is expected at the roughly <math>10^ 19 </math> GeV It may seem premature to be searching for TOE when there is as yet no direct evidence for an electronuclear force, and while in any case there are many different proposed GUTs In fact the name deliberately suggests the involved Nevertheless, most physicists believe this unification is possible, partly due to the past history of convergence towards single theory Supersymmetric GUTs seem plausible not only for their theoretical "beauty", but because they naturally produce large quantities of dark matter, and the inflationary force may be related to GUT physics although it does not seem to form an inevitable part of the theory And yet GUTs are clearly not the final answer Both the current standard model and proposed GUTs are which require the problematic technique of to yield sensible answers This is usually regarded as sign that these are only omitting crucial phenomena relevant only at very high energies Furthermore, the inconsistency between quantum mechanics and general relativity implies that one or both of these must be replaced by theory incorporating unsolved physics Is or or some other variant on this theme, step on the road to "theory of everything", or just blind alley? The mainstream theory of everything at the moment is current research on may eventually play fundamental role in TOE, but that is not its primary aim <ref>Franklin Potter 2005 http://www sciencegems com/discretespace pdf Leptons And Quarks In Discrete Spacetime "</ref> These theories attempt to deal with the renormalization problem by setting up some lower bound on the length scales possible String theories and both believed to be limiting cases of the yet-to-be-defined M-theory suppose that the universe actually has more dimensions than the easily observed three of space and one of time The motivation behind this approach began with the in which it was noted that applying general relativity to five dimensional universe with the usual four dimensions plus one small curled-up dimension yields the equivalent of the usual general relativity in four dimensions together with electromagnetism, also in four dimensions This has led to efforts to work with theories with large number of dimensions in the hopes that this would produce equations that are similar to known laws of physics The notion of extra dimensions also helps to resolve the hierarchy problem, which is the question of why gravity is so much weaker than any other force The common answer involves gravity leaking into the extra dimensions in ways that the other forces do not In the late 1990s, it was noted that one problem with several of the candidates for theories of everything but particularly string theory was that they did not constrain the characteristics of the predicted universe For example, many theories of quantum gravity can create universes with arbitrary numbers of dimensions or with arbitrary Even the "standard" ten-dimensional string theory allows the "curled up" dimensions to be in an enormous number of different ways one estimate is <math>10^ 500 </math> each of which corresponds to different collection of fundamental particles and low-energy forces This array of theories is known as the speculative solution is that many or all of these possibilities are realised in one or another of huge number of universes, but that only small number of them are habitable, and hence the fundamental constants of the universe are ultimately the result of the rather than consequence of the theory of everything This anthropic approach is often criticised in that, because the theory is flexible enough to encompass almost any observation, it cannot make useful as in original, falsifiable, and verifiable predictions In this view, string theory would be considered where an unfalsifiable theory is constantly adapted to fit the experimental results <!--Please do _not_ insert "Time Cube" and "Heim Theory" here without first gaining consensus on the talk page for including

underlying rules are simple and complete, but there are formally undecidable questions about the games behaviors Analogously, it may or may not be possible to completely state the underlying rules of physics with finite number of well-defined laws, but there is little doubt that there are questions about the behavior of physical systems which are formally undecidable on the basis of those underlying laws Since most physicists would consider the statement of the underlying rules to suffice as the definition of "theory of everything", these researchers argue that Gödels Theorem does not mean that TOE cannot exist On the other hand, the physicists invoking Gödels Theorem appear, at least in some cases, to be referring not to the underlying rules, but to the understandability of the

using self-organizing purely semantic information No physical theory to date is believed to be precisely accurate Instead, physics has proceeded by series of "successive approximations" allowing more and more accurate predictions over wider and wider range of phenomena Some physicists believe that it is therefore mistake to confuse theoretical models with the true nature of reality, and hold that the series of approximations will never terminate in the "truth" Einstein himself expressed this view on occasions <ref>Einstein, letter to Felix Klein, 1917 on determinism and approximations Quoted in Pais 1982 Ch 17 </ref> On this view, we may reasonably hope for theory of everything which self-consistently incorporates all currently known forces, but should not expect it to be the final answer On the other hand it is often claimed that, despite the apparently ever-increasing complexity of the mathematics of each new theory, in deep sense associated with their underlying and the number of s, the theories are becoming simpler If so, the process of simplification cannot continue indefinitely There is philosophical debate within the physics community as to whether theory of everything deserves to be called the fundamental law of the universe <ref>e see Weinberg 1993 Ch </ref> One view is the hard position that the TOE is the fundamental law and that all other theories that apply within the universe are consequence of the TOE Another view is that laws called "free floating laws" by which govern the behavior of s, should be seen as equally fundamental Examples are the and the theory of The point being that, although in our universe these laws describe systems whose behaviour could "in principle" be predicted from TOE, they would also hold in universes with different low-level laws, subject only to some very general conditions Therefore it is of no help, even in principle, to invoke low-level laws when discussing the behavior of complex systems Some argue that this attitude would violate if completely valid TOE were formulated It is not clear that there is any point at issue in these debates between Steven Weinberg and other than the right to apply the high-status word "fundamental" to their respective subjects of interest Although the name "theory of everything" suggests the determinism of Laplaces quote, this gives very misleading impression Determinism is frustrated by the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical predictions, by the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions that leads to and by the extreme mathematical difficulty of applying the theory Thus, although the current standard model of particle physics "in principle" predicts all known non-gravitational phenomena, in practice only few quantitative results have been derived from the full theory the masses of some of the simplest and these results especially the particle masses which are most relevant for low-energy physics are less accurate than existing experimental measurements The true TOE would almost certainly be even harder to apply The main motive for seeking TOE, apart from the pure intellectual satisfaction of completing centuries-long quest, is that all prior successful unifications have predicted new phenomena, some of which have proved of great practical importance As in other cases of theory reduction, the TOE would also allow us to confidently define the domain of validity and residual error of low-energy approximations to the full theory which could be used for practical calculations Some of the biggest problems facing current TOE attempts are related to Einsteins theories of relativity None of the current attempted TOEs give structure of matter that gives rise to the special relativity corrections to mass, length and time when particle moves Those corrections are just imposed as if it is some unknown property of space Also Einstein introduced an approximation when he derived his gravitational field equations in his general theory of relativity It can be found in his equations 20 of his 1916 paper Die Grunlage der allgemeinen Relativätstheorie, Ann der Phys 49, 769 Trying to match theory to an approximation is always going to be difficult It is believed that success will be easier when those two factors are taken into consideration main Theory of everything philosophy The status of physical TOE is open to debate For example, if is true, physical TOE will coincide with philosophical theory of everything Some philosophers et al have attempted to construct all-encompassing systems Others are highly dubious about the very possibility of such an exercise wrote in that even if we had TOE, it would necessarily be set of equations He wrote, "What breathes fire into the equations to make universe for the equations to describe?" Of course, the ultimate irreducible brute fact would then be "why those equations?"
