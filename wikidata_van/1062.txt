For flight, Finn uses standard Air Skimmer III Unlike the Ultra, Finns standard Skimmer sacrifices armor for speed and maneuverability Finn has retractable crossbow built into the bow of the vehicle, which operates in basically the same manner as his handheld one In addition to its speed, Finns Skimmer has pair of Nimbus engines, which are designed to make as little noise as possible when holding off on the throttle As running gag, Finns vehicle is almost always cut in half or otherwise destroyed during combat Furthermore, rather than use his parachute, Finn will generally proceed to land on his nuts on one of his friends rides, along with high-pitched greeting to said friend Example: "Hey Hows It Going" he usually says it in pain
