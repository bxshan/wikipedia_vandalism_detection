2009 marked an unpressidented year for the Southerners The production "Of Thee Sing" has been heralded as the Southerners most outstanding performance to date Between the raw power behind the sound of the Southerners hornline and the pagentry uplifting our nation, This performance was nothing less than outstanding Closing the show is stellar arrangement, by Justin Williams, of the National Anthem The Southerners have also encorporated the end of the finale into the National Anthem played pre-game It will be difficult for the Southerners to surpass this show but we are waiting until the production for the year 2010 BLOW SOUTHERNERS BLOW!!!
