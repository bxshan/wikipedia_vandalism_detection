powers—the Senate must give "advice and consent" to many important Presidential appointments, and the House must introduce any bills for the purpose of raising revenue The consent of both chambers is required to pass any legislation, which then may only become law by being signed by the President; if the President vetoes such legislation, however, both houses of Congress must then repass the

of Congress, the Presidents signature is required to make these bills law; in this respect, the President has the power to veto congressional legislation Congress can override presidential veto with

Congress from time to time usually once year The Constitution does not specify that the State of the Union address be delivered in person; it can be in the form of letter, as was the practice during most of the 19th century Although the Presidents constitutional role may appear to be constrained, in practice, the office carries enormous prestige that typically eclipses the power of Congress The Vice President is first in the line of succession, and is the President of the Senate ex officio, with the ability to cast tie-breaking vote The members of the Presidents Cabinet are responsible for administering the various departments of state, including the the and the These departments and department heads have considerable regulatory and political power, and it is they who are responsible for executing federal laws and regulations Main United States Cabinet Main List of United States federal agencies The day-to-day enforcement and administration of federal laws is in the hands of the various created by Congress to deal with specific areas of national and international affairs The heads of the 15 departments, chosen by the President and approved with the "advice and consent" of the Senate, form council of advisers generally known as the Presidents "Cabinet" In addition to departments, there are number of staff organizations grouped into the These include the staff, the the the the the and the The employees in these United States government agencies are called There are also such as the the NASA the CIA the and the In addition, there are such as the and the By law, each agency must submit an annual Section 300 report to the Presidents Office of Management and Budget This is part of larger set of more extensive annual requirements called Circular A-11 Section 300 specifically covers planning, budgeting, acquisition, and management of capital assets The details on how agencies collect and share information and how they are upgrading and improving their information technology decisions are becoming increasingly important Within Section 300 there is special exhibit called Exhibit 53 which gives extensive details on agency information technology investments These investments make up most of the information technology investments from the annual budgets For the 2008s budget, that spending exceeds 66 billion Main United States federal courts The is the highest court in the federal court system The court deals with matters pertaining to the federal government, disputes between states, and interpretation of the United States Constitution, and can declare legislation or executive action made at any level of the government as nullifying the law and creating for future law and decisions Below the Supreme Court are the and below them in turn are the which are the general trial courts for federal law Separate from, but not entirely independent of, this federal court system are the individual court systems of each state, each dealing with its own laws and having its own court rules and procedures The is the final authority on the interpretation of that states laws and constitution case may be appealed from state court to the Supreme Court only if there is an issue arising under the Constitution, or laws/treaties of the United States The relationship between federal and state laws is extremely complex and confusing as result of the unique nature of American federalism For example, state supreme court is bound only by the Supreme Courts interpretation of federal law, but is not bound by interpretation of federal law by the federal court of appeals for the circuit in which the state sits, or even the federal district courts located in the state Conversely, federal district court hearing matter involving only question of state law usually through must apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits, as if the federal court were court of that state but at the same time, the case is heard under the instead of local rules, which may be quite different Together the laws of the federal and state governments form The federal judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, whose justices are appointed for life by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and various "lower" or "inferior courts," among which are the courts of appeals and district courts The divided the nation into and created federal courts for each district From that beginning has evolved the present structure: the Supreme Court, 13 courts of appeals, 94 district courts, and two courts of special jurisdiction Congress retains the power to create and abolish federal courts, as well as to determine the number of judges in the federal judiciary system It cannot, however, abolish the Supreme Court There are three levels of federal courts with general jurisdiction, meaning that these courts handle criminal cases and civil law suits between individuals The other courts, such as the and the tax court, are specialized courts handling only certain kinds of cases The bankruptcy courts are branches of the district courts, but technically are not considered part of the "" judiciary because their judges do not have lifetime tenure Similarly, the tax court is not an Article III court The district courts are the "trial courts" where cases are filed and decided The United States courts of appeals are "appellate courts" that hear appeals of cases decided by the district courts, and some direct appeals from administrative agencies The Supreme Court hears appeals from the decisions of the courts of appeals or state supreme courts on constitutional matters as well as having over very small number of cases The judicial power extends to cases arising under the Constitution, an or cases affecting s, s, and of foreign countries in the controversies in which the government is party; controversies between states or their citizens and foreign nations or their citizens or subjects and bankruptcy cases The removed from federal jurisdiction cases in which citizens of one state were the plaintiffs and the government of another state was the defendant It did not disturb federal jurisdiction in cases in which state government is plaintiff and citizen of another state the defendant The power of the federal courts extends both to civil actions for damages and other redress, and to criminal cases arising under federal law Article III has resulted in complex set of relationships between state and federal courts Federal courts can sometimes hear cases arising under state law pursuant to state courts can decide certain matters involving federal law, and handful of federal claims are primarily reserved to the state courts for example, those arising from the Both court systems thus have in some areas and in others The Constitution safeguards judicial independence by providing that federal judges shall hold office "during good behaviour"; in practice, this usually means they serve until they die, retire, or resign judge who commits an offence while in office may be in the same way as the President or other officials of the federal government judges are appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate Another Constitutional provision prohibits Congress from reducing the pay of any judge Congress is able to set lower salary for all future judges that take office after the reduction, but may not decrease the rate of pay for judges already in office Main Elections in the United States commonly known as the ability to vote, has changed significantly over time In the early years of the United States, voting was considered matter for state governments, and was commonly restricted to white men who owned land Direct elections were mostly held only for the House of Representatives and state legislatures, although what specific bodies were elected by the electorate varied from state to state Under this original system, both representing each state in the Senate were chosen by majority vote of the state legislature Since the ratification of the in 1913, members of both houses of Congress have been directly elected Today, partially due to the citizens have almost from the age of 18, regardless of race, gender, or wealth, and both Houses of Congress are directly elected The only exception to this is the and in some states former felons as well Currently, the national representation of territories and the federal district of in Congress is residents of the District of Columbia are subject to federal laws and federal taxes, but their only congressional representative is Residents of territories have varying rights; for example, some residents of pay federal income taxes though they must pay all other federal taxes, including

because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the IRS code, and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland, more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island This occurs because "the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has wider set of responsibilities than do State and local governments" See http://www gao gov/products/GAO-06-541 As residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, Puerto Ricans are eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement, but are excluded from the SSI Commonwealth of Puerto Rico residents, unlike residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and residents of the 50 States, do not receive the SSI See http://www socialsecurity gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook 21/handbook-2114 html and the island actually receives less than 15% of the funding it would normally receive if it were

federal government; as result, they handle the majority of issues most relevant for most individuals within their jurisdiction Because state governments lack the power to print currency, they must raise revenue either through taxes or bonds both of which are politically unpopular As result, state governments tend to impose severe budget cuts at any time the economy is faltering, which are
