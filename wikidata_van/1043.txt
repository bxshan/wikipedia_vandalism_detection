instance, enrichment activities as means of alleviating or or as reward for on-task behavior In order to warrant such an IEP, student needs to be diagnosed with separate emotional or learning that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in typical These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs Attempts to provide gifted education can be classified in several ways Most gifted students use combination of approaches at different times Activities such as foreign languages, give an extra intellectual challenge outside of school hours On the primary school level, students spend all class time with their peers, but receive extra material to challenge them may be as simple as modified provided by the regular classroom teacher, or it might include formal programs such as or academic competitions such as s, or This work is done in addition to, and not instead of, any regular school work assigned Critics of this approach argue that it requires gifted students to do more work, not the same amount of work but at higher level On the secondary school level sometimes an option is to take more courses like etc, or to engage in extra curriculum activities The regular school material is compacted by pretesting the student to establish which skills and content have already been mastered Pretests can be presented on daily basis doing the most difficult items on worksheet first and skipping the rest if they are performed correctly or before week or longer unit of instructional time When student demonstrates an appropriate level of proficiency, further repetitive practice can be safely skipped, thus reducing the boredom and freeing up time for the student to work on more challenging material Self-pacing methods, such as the use flexible grouping practices to allow children to advance at their own pace Self-pacing can be beneficial for all children and is not targeted specifically at those identified as gifted or talented, but it can allow children to learn at highly accelerated rate Directed Studies are usually based on the students self pacing Pupils are advanced to higher-level class covering material more suited to their abilities and preparedness This may take the form of or completing normal curriculum in shorter-than-normal period of time "telescoping" Subject acceleration also called partial acceleration is flexible approach which can advance student in one field, such as mathematics or language, without changing other studies, such as and sports Some colleges offer that give gifted younger students the opportunity to attend college early In the many allow advanced students to enroll with the consent of school officials and their parents Acceleration presents gifted children with academic material from established curricula that is commensurate with their ability and preparedness, and for this reason is low-cost option from the perspective of the school However this may result in small number of children taking classes targeted at older children, and individual students in an acceleration program may or may not feel socially accepted by year or more older students The social disconnect is most apparent when profoundly gifted young child is enrolled in classes with teenagers and young adults It is least apparent when moderately gifted student is advanced by only one or two years Some advocates have argued that the disadvantages of being retained in standard mixed-ability classroom are substantially worse For example, Miraca Gross reports: "the majority of these children retained in typical classroom are socially rejected by their same-age peers with typical academic talents isolated, and deeply unhappy Children of 180+ who are retained in the regular classroom are even more seriously at risk and

counties also choose to form their own Talented and Gifted Programs Sometimes this means that an individual county will form its own TAG program; sometimes several counties will come together if not enough gifted students are present in single county Generally, TAG program focuses on specific age group, particularly the local TAG programs This could mean elementary age, high school age, or by years such as ages through 14 These classes are generally organized so that students have the opportunity to choose several courses they wish to participate in Courses offered often vary between subjects, but are not typically strictly academically related to that subject For example, TAG course that could be offered in history could be the students learning about certain event and then acting it out in performance to be presented to parents on the last night of the program These courses are designed to challenge the students to think in new ways and not merely to be lectured as they are in school Gifted students are educated in either separate class or separate school Classes like this are sometimes called "Congregated Gifted Classes" In the these schools are called the They are popular and growing fast Separate or independent schools are schools with primary mission to serve the needs of the academically gifted Such schools are relatively scarce and often difficult for families to locate Such schools often need to work to guard their mission from occasional charges of elitism, support the professional growth and training of their staff, write curriculum units that are specifically designed to meet the social, emotional, and academic talents of their students, and educate their parent population at all ages Some classes offer directed studies, where the students lead class themselves and decide on their own projects, tests, and all other assignments These separate classes or schools tend to be more expensive than regular classes, due to the smaller number of kids in classroom They are in high demand and parents have to pay part of the costs :For list of more than one hundred local programs at schools all around the world, see Talented and Gifted program

states, the population of gifted students who are being is rising quite rapidly, as school districts responding to budgetary issues and standards-based policies are cutting what limited gifted education program remain extant, and families seek educational opportunities that are tailored to each childs unique needs Controversies concerning gifted education are varied and often highly politicized They are as as agreeing upon the appropriateness of the term gifted or the definition of giftedness For example, does giftedness refer to or such as inherent intelligence Many students do not exhibit both at the same time Measures of general intelligence also remain controversial Early IQ tests were notorious for producing higher IQ scores for privileged races and classes and lower scores for disadvantaged subgroups Although IQ tests have changed substantially over the past half century, and many objections to the early tests have been addressed by culture neutral tests such as the IQ testing remains controversial Some schools and districts only accept IQ tests as evidence of giftedness This brings scrutiny to the fact that many affluent families can afford to consult with an to test their children, whereas families with limited income cannot afford the test and must depend on district resources Gifted programs are often seen as being elitist in places where the majority of students receiving gifted services are from privileged This is the most hotly debated aspect of gifted education Some people believe that gifted education resources lack availability and They feel that in the alternate methods of gifted education, the gifted students "miss out" on having "normal" at least insofar as "normal childhood" is defined as attending school in mixed-ability classroom Others believe that gifted education allows gifted students to interact with peers that are on their level, be adequately challenged, and leaves them better equipped to take on the challenges of life Another facet of this is the effectiveness of the programs dependent upon resources that are pushed more toward students who are struggling Gifted Education is not mandated in many states, making it elective for districts to earmark money for Many lower-achieving districts and schools must make crisis decisions on programs that are not high priorities As result, gifted students at these schools are not served, or not served effectively Some critics have claimed that gifted programs result in educational with the gifted program taking disproportionate amount of school resources, leaving other pupils with much reduced resources See, for example, the writings of There is little evidence of such effects, especially in contrast with the resource consumption of programs The most common gifted programs are also the lowest cost: skipping grades and modified assignments in the regular classroom Gifted programs can also face problems with the singling out of the gifted

similar interests and abilities Fact date September 2008 While giftedness is seen as an academic advantage, psychologically it can pose other challenges for the gifted individual person who is

to call on the talented student in class so that typical students have an opportunity to participate Students who are young, enthusiastic or aggressive are more likely to attract attention and to
