The loudest laugh ever recorded was made by Faye Walker at an ear breaking 1045 decibels The amount of noise generated from the girls vocal cords was louder then 10 Boeing jets taking off simultaneously, 400 washing machines on full spin, and Cilla Skelton telling Age Concern customers about weather station at Pickering Point All at the SAME time The resulting ‘screech’ ended up shattering every glass window in the wath, swinton, mexbrough and Rotherham district The repair bill ran into millions of £’s!
