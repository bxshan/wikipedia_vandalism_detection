The introduction to the third part of the book is the last words of Jonathans teacher: "Keep working on love In this part Jonathan understands that the spirit cannot be really free without the ability to forgive, and that the way to progress leads—for him, at least—through becoming teacher, not just through working hard as student Jonathan returns to the Breakfast Flock to share his newly discovered ideals and the recent tremendous experience, ready for the difficult fight against the current rules of that society The ability to forgive seems to be mandatory "passing condition "Do you want to fly so much that you will forgive the Flock, and learn, and go back to them one day and work to help them know?" Jonathan asks his first student, Fletcher Lynd Seagull, before getting into any further talks The idea that the stronger can reach more by leaving the weaker friends behind seems totally rejected Hence, love, deserved respect, and forgiveness all seem to be equally important to the freedom from the pressure to obey the rules just because they are commonly accepted
