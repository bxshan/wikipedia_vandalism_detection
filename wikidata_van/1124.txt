Yuya came from the ian town of where he probably owned an estate and was wealthy member of this towns local nobility His origins remain unclear As the study of his mummy showed, Yuya had been man of taller than average stature and the anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith considered that his appearance was not typically Egyptian Taking into account his unusual name and features, some believe that Yuya was of foreign origin, although this is far from certain <ref>David OConnor Eric Cline, Amenhotep: Perspectives on his Reign, University of Michigan, 1998, 5</ref> The name Yuya may be spelled in five different ways as Gaston Maspero noted decades ago in 1907 book—The Tomb of Iouiya and Touiyou <ref>OConnor Cline, 5</ref> These include "iAy", ywiA", yw reed-leaf with walking feet A, ywiw" and, in orthography—normally sign of something foreign--"y man with hand to mouth iA" <ref>Masperos analysis of Yuyas complex name is given on page xiii-xiv of The Tomb of Iouiya and Touiyou" by Theodore Davis, Archibald Constable and Co Ltd, 1907</ref> It was not typical for an Egyptian person to have so many different ways to write his name; this may suggest that Yuyas ancestors had foreign, although not necessarily Mitannian, origin In "The Hebrew Pharaohs of Egypt" ISBN 1-59143-022-4 One solution is that Yuya had some an ancestry; this argument is based on the fact that the knowledge of horses and chariotry was introduced into Egypt from Asia and Yuya was the king’s "Master of the Horse It was also suggested Yuya was the brother of queen who was the mother of and may have had Mitannian royal origins <ref>Anthony David Rosalie David, Biographical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, London: Seaby, 1992, 167 ISBN 1-85264-032-4</ref> However, this hypothesis can not be substantiated, since nothing is known of Mutemwiyas background While Yuya lived in Upper Egypt, an area that was predominantly native Egyptian, he could have been an assimiliated descendant of tic immigrants or slaves who rose to become member of the local nobility at Akhmin If he was not foreigner, however, then Yuya would have been the native Egyptian whose daughter was married to Amenhotep III
