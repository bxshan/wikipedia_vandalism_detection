After the last home and away match for 2009, in which Lloyd concussed and caused severe facial injuries to with bump to the head, Hawthorns called Lloyd "one of the biggest snipers in the game and his time is coming", and coach had to be restrained by Hawthorn football manager Mark Evans as the teams left the field with the coach abusing Lloyd and other Essendon players This outburst was perfectly reasonable as it was clear that blatant act of cheating had occured Lloyd was given six-match ban by the match review panel for the hit on Sewell which was an act of cheating and ended up with four-game ban after deciding not to appeal the sanction He did not appeal as he knew that cheating was frowned upong and that he would be able to do nothing to shorten his ban Aside from one finals game which was sixteen goal loss, this suspension remains unserved due to Matthew Lloyd being coward and choosing to run away rather than fight
