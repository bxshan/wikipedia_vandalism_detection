Scorpions have quite variable lifespans and the actual lifespan of most species is not known The age range appears to be approximately 4–25 years 25 years being the maximum reported life span in the species Hadrurus arizonensis Lifespan of Hadogenes species in the wild is estimated at 25–30 years Scorpions prefer to live in areas where the temperatures range from 20 ;°C to 37 ;°C 68 ;°F to 99 ;°F but may survive from freezing temperatures to the desert heat <ref> cite journal last Hadley first Neil year 1970 title Water Relations of the Desert Scorpion, Hadrurus Arizonensis journal The Journal of Experimental Biology volume 53 pages 547–558 url http://jeb biologists org/cgi/reprint/53/3/547 pdf accessdate 2008-06-13 </ref><ref> cite journal last Hoshino first coauthors Moura De Paula year 2006 title Selection of Environmental Temperature by the Yellow Scorpion Tityus serrulatus Lutz Mello, 1922 Scorpiones, Buthidae journal Journal of Venomous Animals and Toxins including Tropical Diseases volume 12 issue pages 59–66 url http://www scielo br/pdf/jvatitd/v12n1/28301 pdf accessdate 2008-06-13 doi 10 1590/S1678-91992006000100005 </ref> Scorpions of the genus living in high Asian mountains, scorpions from Patagonia and small scorpions from middle Europe can all survive winter temperatures of about −25 ;°C In there live seven species of scorpions of which Pectinibuthus birulai is in temperatures which vary from 49,9 ;°C to -31 ;°C <ref> Kovařík, František; Štíři Scorpions Jihlava 1998, 19</ref> They are and finding shelter during the day in the relative cool of underground holes or undersides of rocks and coming out at night to hunt and feed Scorpions exhibit behavior, primarily to evade detection by their predators such as birds, centipedes, lizards, mice, possums, and rats <ref> cite web url http://www amonline net au/factsheets/scorpions htm title Scorpions accessdate 2008-06-13 publisher Australian Museum </ref> Scorpions are opportunistic predators of small arthropods and insects They use their chelae pincers to catch the prey initially Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with venom This will kill or paralyze the prey so the scorpion can eat it Scorpions have relatively unique style of eating using small claw-like structures that protrude from the mouth that are unique to the among arthropods The chelicerae, which are very sharp, are used to pull small amounts of food off the prey item for digestion Scorpions can only digest food in liquid form; any solid matter fur, etc is disposed of by the scorpion
